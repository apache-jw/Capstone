This paper examines the charging behavior of 7,979 plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners in
California. The study investigates where people charge be it at home, at work, or at public lo-cation, and the level of charging they use including level 1, level 2, or DC fast charging. While
plug-in behavior can di ﬀer among PEV owners based on their travel patterns, preferences, and
access to infrastructure studies often make generalizations about charging behavior. In this study,
we explore di ﬀerences in charging behavior among di ﬀerent types of PEV owners based on their
use of charging locations and levels, we then identify factors associated with PEV owner ’s choice
of charging location and charging level. We identi ﬁed socio-demographic (gender and age),
vehicle characteristics, commute behavior, and workplace charging availability as signi ﬁcant
factors related to the choice of charging location.
1. Introduction
Plug-in-electric vehicles (PEVs), which include Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are
being adopted rapidly as an alternative to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. In contrast to ICE vehicles, PEVs can be refueled
(charged) anywhere if an electrical outlet is available. Charging in the U.S. is grouped into three categories based on charging power:
Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), and DC Fast. Level 1 provides charging through a 120-volt plug adding 2 to 5 miles of range per hour of
charging (1.2– 1.8 kW AC), Level 2 charges a PEV through a 240- or 208-volt point adding 10 to 20 miles of range per hour of charging
(3.6– 22 kW AC), and a DC Fast point can supply power up to 480-volt allowing 50 to 70 miles to be added per 20 min of charging (at
50 kW or more). Although a substantial amount of research has investigated PEV charging behavior and electricity consumption,
most of the studies focused on time-of-day dynamics of PEV charging demand like start time, plug-in type, charging time, idle time, or
charging location ( Hardman et al., 2018).
Travel patterns and vehicle driving ranges primarily impact PEV owners ’charging needs. Past studies have identi ﬁed four main
locations at which charging occurs - overnight charging at or near home, at workplaces, at publicly accessible locations like those
near grocery stores, shopping malls, and in parking lots; and on travel corridors where drivers stop between their trip origin and
destination points ( Idaho National Laboratory, 2015; Ji et al., 2015; M. Nicholas et al., 2017; Nicholas and Tal, 2015 ). Though,
multiple studies have tried to identify the optimal location for building infrastructure for PEVs, depending on the source and nature ofdata (stated or revealed) results can vary substantially ( Dong et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2015; Santini et al., 2014; Tal and Dunckley, 2016;
Weiller, 2011). Combining stated preference survey with Global Positioning System (GPS) data, Nicholas et al. ( 2017 ) found that the

Tdesired location stated by households is usually signi ﬁcantly further away from their home than the actual charging location they use.
Studies that investigate the temporal trends in charging behavior also indicate home location charging at the nighttime is the most
frequently used charging type. Studies using questionnaire surveys ﬁnd that consumers are most likely to plug their vehicles in when
they arrive at work in the morning, and when they return home in the evening ( Axsen et al., 2011; Schäuble et al., 2017 ). Easy access
andﬂexibility of charging time are the major drivers of home charging which also encourage people to adopt PEVs ( Bailey et al.,
2015; Nicholas and Tal, 2017; Plötz and Funke, 2017; Skippon and Garwood, 2011; Tal and Dunckley, 2016 ). In addition to con-
venience, one factor that drives overnight home charging is the use of time-of-use (TOU) electricity tari ﬀs. A 2016 study in California
found that these tari ﬀs, which provide cheaper electricity during the nighttime, encourage consumers to charge their vehicles at
home overnight ( Tal and Dunckley, 2016 ).
Overall, overnight home charging has the highest share of charging events among all locations- 50% to 80% of charging events for
PEVs occur at home ( California ’s Advanced Clean Cars Midterm Review Appendix G: Plug-in Electric Vehicle In-Use and Charging
Data Analysis, 2017; Franke and Krems, 2013 ). However, this dominance of home charging di ﬀers in situations where consumers do
not have access to home charging. Workplace or commute location charging is the next most favorable option among PEV owners
(Björnsson and Karlsson, 2015; Figenbaum and Kolbenstvedt, 2016; Nicholas and Tal, 2015; Skippon and Garwood, 2011 ). According
to Tal et al. ( Nicholas and Tal, 2013 ) a signi ﬁcant driver for charging at work was employers providing charging for free. Also,
workplace charging is more important for BEV owners than PHEV owners who can rely on the ICE driving mode of their car when the
battery is depleted ( Nicholas and Tal, 2015). Approximately 15– 20% of the charging events occur at the workplace for BEV owners.
Publicly accessible charging locations in shopping malls or parking lots and those located on travel corridors are the least usedcharging locations at present. Only approximately 5% of the charging events occur at these locations. In spite of the low share of
charging events at these locations, public infrastructure is still required to encourage adoption of the PEVs as it o ﬀers a safety net to
BEV owners on longer trips( Dong et al., 2014; Morrissey et al., 2016; M. Nicholas et al., 2017; Plötz and Funke, 2017; Tal et al.,
2014). In recent years, DC fast charging options are being o ﬀered in public charging stations. These chargers are generally more
important for long-range BEV owners since they are more likely to use their car for longer trips ( Figenbaum and Kolbenstvedt, 2016;
Ji et al., 2015; Neaimeh et al., 2017; Nicholas and Tal, 2017; Nicholas et al., 2013 ). Publicly-available fast charging options can
reduce range anxiety and encourage adoption of PEVs. Research on charging levels typically ﬁnds that L1 or L2 charging is preferable
in locations with long dwell times, such as home or at work and that DC fast charging is used for long distance trips ( Dong et al., 2014;
Figenbaum and Kolbenstvedt, 2016 ). L1 charging results in slow charging times, which may not be an issue with small battery BEVs
and PHEVs, however it may not be su ﬃcient for longer range BEVs when charging at home, depending on their daily travel patterns
(M. A. Nicholas et al., 2017b).
Consumers can charge at home, work, and in public locations, they could charge at only one of these locations, some combination
of two locations, or all three locations. In this study. we aim to investigating why consumers charge their vehicles at any of thepotential locational combinations. Along with the choice to use any combination of charging locations, PEV owners also have a
choice of charging levels at some of these locations. To accurately model the e ﬀect of statewide or nationwide PEV charging demands
on future infrastructure needs and on the power grid, it is important to understand the usage pattern of L1, L2, and DC Fast chargers
at relevant locations like home, work, and public. In addition, it is critical to understand the factors driving this charging behavior
and choice of charging location. The literature related to charging behavior and use of chargers have often considered the importance
of public, workplace, and home infrastructure in isolation. However, in reality the infrastructure is often used in an integrated way
with PEV owners plugging in at multiple locations to satisfy their charging needs. We were unable to identify any studies that
investigate the combined choice of charging locations. Better understanding of how the charging infrastructure is used by PEV owners
and the factors characterizing this behavior will be particularly important when we develop policies for future PEV buyers. It will be
possible to forecast better their usage of charging infrastructure based on the charging environment, their demographic character-
istics, and travel behavior. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to identify the di ﬀerent locational charging patterns of
PEV owners, focusing on the usage of di ﬀerent types of chargers at di ﬀerent locations. Subsequently, using a multinomial logit model
we explore the e ﬀects of socio-demographic, vehicle characteristics, and access to charging facilities on the choice of charging
infrastructure.
The multinomial model despite the restrictive Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption allows us to
obtain an approximate estimate of the factors that drive charging behavior among PEV owners.
2. Data
The data used in this study is drawn from a cohort survey of PEV owners in California conducted in the years 2016 and 2017.
Participants who owned at least one PEV were recruited based on Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) registration data and the
Clean Vehicle Rebate Program (CVRP) database using a random sampling procedure. The response rate for the completed survey was
about 15%. There were six categories of questions on: travel behavior, driving behavior, vehicle performance, vehicle characteristics,
response to PEV related incentives, and charging behavior. For charging behavior, we asked the respondent to provide 7-days of
charging history and answer if their PEV was charged at the following locations with the given types of chargers:
Level 1 Home
Level 2 Home
Level 1 Work
Level 2 Work
DC Fast charger WorkJ.H. Lee, et al. Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249
2Level 1 Public, referring to non-home and non-work locations (e.g. public chargers, highway corridor chargers, Tesla super-
chargers)
Level 2 Public
DC Fast charger Public
For each day, a respondent must indicate which of the above option they used. In addition, we also asked them to record whether
charging at work was paid or free, the type of electricity plan, and what they estimate is the cost of charging at home, membership ofcharging network companies, and the characteristics of their workplace and home charging infrastructure. In this study, from the
pool of survey respondents we analyze a sub-sample of 7,979 PEV owners who charge at least once during the 7-days for which the
charging history has been reported.
Considering the market penetration of PEVs, many current owners are still early adopters of the technology. As observed in the
case of other technologies, early adopters may have some unique characteristics –age- group, education level, household income,
technology awareness among others. Descriptive statistics of the sample of PEV owners analyzed here are presented in Table 1.
More than 80% of households in the sample have income higher than the median income in California ($77,359 according to the
Census American Community Survey 1-year survey 2017) and the percentage of people with graduate or professional degrees is48.7% (California statewide 12.3%). Our dataset contains more males who are the primary user of the PEV, and the sample has
slightly more BEV owners than PHEV owners. More than 80% of respondents owned homes that are detached units. The sample is
dominated by a few PEV models; about 50% of respondents with BEVs have the Chevrolet Bolt, Tesla Model S or the Nissan Leaf, and
a considerable number of the PHEV households own the Prius plug-in hybrid or the Chevrolet Volt.
Fig. 1 shows the di ﬀerence in charging behavior between BEV and PHEV users as observed in the data. Overall, BEV owners use
Level 2 chargers at home (about 40% of charging events) slightly more than PHEV owners (less than 30%). The frequency of home
charging behavior does not appear to be a ﬀected by the day of the week. Work charging was signi ﬁcantly reduced during the
weekend for both BEV and PHEV users, presumably because few respondents work on the weekends. The number of BEV users whodid not charge during a particular day was twice that of the PHEV users. This di ﬀerence is perhaps due to the longer electric driving
ranges of BEVs allowing for multiple days of travel to be completed on one charge. Whereas for PHEV owners, if they wish to drivetheir vehicle using electric propulsion they will need to charge everyday assuming they have typical commute distances.
3. Methodology
First, we classify respondents in our sample into distinct groups based on their choice of charging location in the 7-day period.
Second, we explore the relationship between choice of charging location and di ﬀerent PEV models during weekdays and weekends as
well as investigate any spatial di ﬀerence in the choice of charging location. Finally, we use a regression model to identify the
characteristics of the charging location groups. At all the stages of analysis, BEV and PHEV owners are studied separately. This is done
due to the di ﬀerence in vehicle technology between BEVs and PHEVs and their charging needs. Also, most BEVs in the market can use
DC fast chargers whereas only one PHEV (Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV) can use DC fast charge. This restricts the choice of charginglocation for PHEV drivers and will impact their charging behavior.

4We consider the location of chargers to be based on the perception of the place of the charging event by the survey taker. A home
charging event may not in all cases be a private charger in a driveway, though this is likely as most PEV owners ’live-in single-family
homes. Other forms of home charging include chargers in private parking lots of multi-unit dwellings or chargers on the street side.
Workplace chargers are where PEV buyers park their vehicle when they commute, typically at their workplace, but this could also be
at a transit location or nearby parking garage. Public charging is perhaps the di ﬃcult to conceptualize. A public charger/charging
event for survey takers is one when the vehicle was not plugged-in at home and not at their work. A public charger in a parkinggarage could be one person ’s home charger, another ’s work charger, and another ’s public charger. This is especially true in urban area
with homes, workplaces, shops, restaurants, cafes etc. in close proximity. For the purpose of analysis, public charging events aredeﬁned as those that happen at non-home and non-work location/time.
If a household reported that they only charged at home on all 7- days, then it is classi ﬁed as Home-only . But if a household charged
at home on 6 days and reported a public charging event on 1 day, it is classi ﬁed as Home-public. A household that charged their
vehicle at home, work, and public locations (even once) during the 7-day period is considered in the Allgroup.
3.2. Descriptive analysis of charging pattern
The choice of charging location can di ﬀer by the type of PEV, primarily due to vehicle characteristics like electric range. For
instance, long-range BEV owners (e.g. Tesla and Chevrolet Bolt) may not need to charge at their workplace or at public locations ifthey can fully charge the vehicle overnight at home and have a short commute. The spatial characteristics of a PEV owner ’s re-
sidential location can also play a major role in determining the pattern of use as commute distance and access to public chargers candiﬀer between urban, sub-urban, and rural neighborhoods. For example, households residing and commuting within urban neigh-
borhoods may have greater charging opportunities than households residing in suburban and non-urban areas. Households in sub-urban and non-urban areas may have to depend more on home-charging. Thus, we use cross-classi ﬁcation tables to examine the
relationships between charging behavior and PEV characteristics and the relation between charging patterns and spatial char-acteristics of the PEV owners ’residential locations.
3.3. Model for choice of charging infrastructure use pattern
We use a multinomial logit model to understand the factors driving the group classi ﬁcations. We divide the sample into two
groups (BEV and PHEV owners) and estimate the logit model separately for the two groups. We use e ﬀect coding for the nominal
dependent variable, 7 types of charging behavior, so that we can estimate parameters in terms of di ﬀerences from the average and not
from a reference category ( Vermunt and Magidson, 2015).
With e ﬀect coding, the probability that a household belongs to category m is given as:
∑ =⎛

where mdenotes a charging group like Home-only orWork-public, p denotes the categories in the dependent variable ,Mdenotes the
total number of charging behavior groups such that 1≤m≤M,ziare covariates and y is the outcome variable observed in the data.
Note,∑==β 0mM
mp1for 0≤p≤P, implying the sum of estimated parameters for each independent variable will be zero when
summed over all the categories. As the denominator of the log function in equation (1)shows, with e ﬀect coding, the probability of
belonging to category m is now compared with the average (geometric mean) of the probabilities of all M categories and not to a
reference category. In this way, it is possible to identify the driving factors for all the charging behavior groups.
A major drawback of the multinomial logit model is the assumption of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). The IIA
assumption is problematic particularly if the model estimates are used to make predictions or explain substitution behavior. Since the
objective of this study is to only understand the e ﬀects of sociodemographic characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and workplace
charging facilities on the pattern of infrastructure use, the multinomial logit model using e ﬀect coding is well-suited and the IIA
assumption should not have a signi ﬁcant impact on the results i.e. the direction of e ﬀect of the factors ( Train, 2002).
We use the following 25 explanatory variables: household income, education, age, and gender (Female: 1) of the primary driver,
usage of PEV within household, detached house ownership (Own detached home: 1, other: 0), ownership of solar panels, number of
vehicles in the household, household size, number of drivers in the household, presence of multiple PEVs in the household, vehicle
ﬂeet, age of PEV, workplace charger availability (Yes: 1, No: 0), electric range of PEV, free workplace charging (Yes:1, No: 0), having
time limitation on workplace charging (Yes: 1, No: 0), number of workplace chargers, frequency of change in parking spots forcharging in a month, cost of electricity at home (cents per kWh), charging network membership, commute distance, availability of L1
public chargers within 300 m of residence for PHEV owners, availability of L2 public chargers within 300 m of residence for both
samples, availability of DC Fast public chargers within 300 m of residence for BEV owners sample, urban neighborhood (Urban:1,
other 0), and Tesla ownership (Yes: 1, No 0). The Tesla ownership variable was only used for the BEV model.J.H. Lee, et al. Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249
54. Results
4.1. Descriptive analysis of charging behavior
Fig. 2 shows the proportion of respondents in each charging behavior group and their proportion by di ﬀerent PEV models.
Overall, the proportion of people who rely only on home charging is more than half of the sample (53%). The second and third largest
groups are the people who utilized workplace charging only and those who used public charging facilities together with home
charging. These groups account for 16% and 13% of total PEV owners, respectively. In total, 86% of respondents (including Home-
only, Home-work, Home-public , and All) charged from home indicating that home is the most common charging location chosen by
PEV owners.
The right-hand side of Fig. 2 shows the proportion of charging behavior groups by di ﬀerent PEV models. About half of the
respondents only rely on home charging regardless of the PEV model. The proportion of Work-only andHome-work are comparable
across most short-range (less than100 miles) BEV owners but there were a greater number of Nissan Leaf and BMW i3 BEV users inHome-public and Allgroups than other short range BEVs (e.g. Fiat 500e, Volkswagen e-Golf).
The next most common location is workplace charging. About 30 –40% of BEV owners use workplace charging facilities, with most
of them using the latter along with home charging. Less than 30% of PHEV owners use workplace charging, again most of them
belonging to the Home-work group. After Home-work the next largest group of workplace charging users is the group that uses all three
locations. A smaller group uses a combination of work and other chargers, and another uses only work charging. The public charginggroups are less prominent. The most prominent group that uses public is the Home-public group especially for BEV households. The
most unique charging behavior was found in Tesla users. More than half of Tesla users belonged to the Home-only group , a rate that is
higher than short range BEVs, but comparable to the Chevrolet Bolt which is also a long-range BEV. Another area in which Tesla
diﬀered from other BEVs was the Home-public group which was the largest in comparison to all other models of BEVs and PHEVs. ThisFig. 2. Proportion of charging behavior groups by di ﬀerent PEV models.J.H. Lee, et al. Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249
6pattern could be a result of the access to free supercharger network enjoyed by Tesla owners (at the time of the survey) or the longer
driving ranges of these vehicles which increases the likelihood of long-distance travel requiring public charging.
As the survey may have an over-representation of certain groups of vehicle owners, we re-estimate the proportions using weighted
data. The weights are calculated using data from the CVRP records. The CVRP dataset contains information of about 200,000 plug-in
vehicles that were sold between 2010 and 2017 in California. The purchase year and make of PEVs were used to calculate weights
because model information is not available from CVRP dataset. The bottom chart of Fig. 2 shows the weighted proportion of charging
behavior groups by di ﬀerent PEV models. They are not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from the unweighted one except the proportion of
Home-only group for short-range BEVs (Leaf and i3). A greater number of Leaf users are in the Home-only group of the weighted
sample while there are fewer i3 BEV users in the same group. It is a possibility that the charging pattern observed in the weightedsample of BMW i3 users is related to the incentives and free charging provided by BMW in North America ( BMW, 2016 ).
Along with charging location we also investigate choice of charging levels –L1, L2, or DC fast charging by di ﬀerent charging
behavior groups. Fig. 3 illustrates the average number of PEV charging days using di ﬀerent levels of charging at home, work, and
public locations during the weekdays and weekends by di ﬀerent charging behavior groups. Regardless of BEV owners ’charging
behavior group L2 is the most frequently used charger at home and workplace while DC fast charger is used when charging in public
locations. BEV users ’average number of charging days at home using L1 charger is 0.8 and L2 is 2.7 ( Fig. 3a). These values can be
interpreted as the proportion of L1 and L2 home chargers at BEV owners home locations because there is typically not more than onetype of charger at PEV owners ’homes. Despite BEV owners mostly using L2 chargers, there is still a considerable number of BEV
owners who use L1 chargers at home. BEV owners in the Work-only group use mostly L2 charger, but they also use L1 and DC fast
chargers. People who rely only on public charging locations mostly use DC fast chargers (about 1.5 days in a week) or L2 chargers
(about 0.8 times per week).
TheHome-work group seems to utilize both charging locations in equal proportion, mainly a L1 charger at home and a L2 charger
at work. On the other hand, Home-public orWork-public groups seem to be more dependent on home and workplace chargers (more
than 2 days at these chargers) respectively, primarily using L2 chargers at home or work and DC Fast at public locations. The All
group primarily utilize L2 chargers at home and workplace and are less dependent on charging at public locations using L2 or DC Fastchargers. Fig. 3b show weekend charging behavior of BEV owners, and they are very similar to the weekdays ’pattern except for the
workplace charging.
PHEV owners ’charging behavior is illustrated in Fig. 3c and d. PHEV owners tend to charge more often than BEV owners. More
than 60% of PHEV owners used L1 chargers at home while their main chargers at a workplace or public locations were L2 chargers.Like BEV users, people in Home-work group utilize both home and workplace charging infrastructure equally, mainly using L1 charger
at home and L2 charger at work. PHEV owners in Home-public, Work-public , and Allgroups tend to mainly use the L1 chargers at home
and L2 chargers at work. Like BEV owners, there are no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences between weekdays and weekend charging patterns of

7PHEV owners except for less workplace charging.
Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the seven charging behavior groups for ﬁve diﬀerent types of built environment (urban core,
urban district, urban neighborhood, suburban neighborhood, and non-urban) ( Clifton, 2016 ). This typology of built environments
was developed with multiple land use indicators including community design measures (densities of people, jobs, and housings) and
regional accessibility measures (level of transit services and job accessibilities). More details can be found in the technical mem-
orandum in 2017 National Household Survey California Add-on. While approximately 50% of the PEV owners in urban neighbor-
hoods only charge at home, the dependence on home charging is more in suburban and non-urban locations. Further, the Work-only
andWork-public group is signi ﬁcantly smaller in suburban and non-urban residential areas compared to urban neighborhoods. Here,
we only consider residential location information to map the distribution. The build environment of the commute location can also
inﬂuence the choice of charging location. However, as the median commute distance is 11 miles in the sample, we assume that the
urban density of the commute location is not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from residential density and present only the spatial distribution
of charging behavior groups by the type of build environment of the residential locations.
Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the di ﬀerent behavioral groups in the state of California. Analogous to the location choice pattern
based on build environment ( Fig. 4), the share of the Home-work, Home-other, Work-only, and Work-other group is closely related to the
proximity of the PEV owner ’s residential location to major urban/employment centers in the state. Focusing on the Bay area and
Southern California, we observe that the share of the Work-only andWork-public group is high in dense urban locations of the Bay area
and Southern California like San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles where PEV owners may have higher access to workplace andpublic charging opportunities. On the other hand, PEV owners in the sub-urban and non-urban areas of the state like the Mendocino
county in Northern California or Kern county in the south mostly belonged to the Home-only and Home-public group.
4.2. Logistic regression results
4.2.1. BEV model estimation
Table 2 shows the estimated parameters from the multinomial logit model for BEV owners. The model found that the Home-only
group are more likely to be high-income, older, and owners of detached houses with solar cells, and have L2 charging facility at
home. This group of BEV owners usually don ’t have access to workplace charging or membership with any network like ChargePoint
or EVgo. They are more likely to have a special EV rate or TOU rate allowing them to pay a lower electricity rate per kWh. The Work-
only group tends to have BEVs with shorter range, they are likely to have unlimited free workplace charging, and are more likely to
need to swap their vehicles’ parking location while at work. Swapping parking spaces at work allows one charge point to support
more than one PEV throughout the day, thus reducing the issues of congestion and increasing the availability of workplace chargers
to PEV owners. Unlike the Home-only group, BEV owners in this group are mostly apartment dwellers, renters, or residents of
condominiums. However, like the Home-only group, the Work-only group are less likely to have a membership with any charging
network. The Public-only group of BEV owners are more likely to be renters, apartment, or condominium residents and have a lower
likelihood of having charging facility available at their workplace. The results however show that this group of BEV owners have ahigher likelihood of owning a Tesla. Due to their access to Tesla ’s supercharger network, this group of BEV owners can use public
chargers to satisfy their charging needs. Other potential reasons for belonging to the Public-only charging group are, being renters or
residents of condominiums/apartments meaning they are less likely to have chargers at home. The logit model results also show that
the BEV owners in this group on average have lower household incomes, though their average annual income of $163,000 is not low

8when compared to the average Californian household.
Among the households using multiple locations for vehicle charging, BEV owners in the Home-work group are more likely to be
owners of detached houses and have older BEVs with shorter driving ranges. Due to shorter driving ranges, drivers may be more
motivated to utilize both L2 chargers at home and chargers available at work. This group of BEV owners is likely to revise their home
electricity rate plan as well as use free workplace chargers to lower the operating cost of their vehicle. As the results indicate, they are
Fig. 5. Distribution of charging behavior groups in California by county.J.H. Lee, et al. Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249
9less likely to be Tesla owners. Also, BEV owners in this group are less likely to have a membership of charging networks restricting
them to home and workplace charging. BEV owners in the Home-public group are more likely to have lower income than the average
BEV owner. However, they are more likely to be Tesla owners, have solar, and have L2 chargers at home. They are more likely to havemembership with a charging network. Workplace charging is less likely to be available to this group. BEV owners in the Work-public
group and the Work-only group are similar to each other except for two characteristics. The former is more likely to have membership
to charging networks and have a higher likelihood of being apartment dwellers with public charger availability within 300 m of their
multi-unit dwelling. Lastly, people who utilized all charging location are more likely to be young, own older BEVs, and have access to
chargers at the workplace.
4.2.2. PHEV model estimation
Table 3 shows the estimated parameters from the multinomial logit model for PHEV owners. Overall, fewer parameters were
signiﬁcant compared to the BEV model, though the characteristics that were signi ﬁcant are similar to the BEV model. The Home-only
group for PHEV owners are more likely to be older, owners of detached house, and who own short range PHEVs (e.g. Toyota Prius
Plug-in Hybrid). This group of PHEV owners do not have access to workplace charging facilities and if available it is not free, has time
limits, and may have a lower guarantee of ﬁnding an available charger. Like BEV owners, if the primary driver of the PHEV is a
female then they are more likely to be in the Home-only group. PHEV owners in the Work-only group are also similar to the corre-
sponding group among BEV owners (renters, apartment, and condominium dwellers with access to free or paid workplace charging
and no charging limits). However, unlike BEV users, commute distance matters and PHEV owners in this group tend to commute
shorter distance than other charging behavior groups. The Public-only group in PHEV owners are less likely to have access to free
workplace charging or home L2 chargers. They also tend to use older PHEVs and have a lower number of vehicles in households. As aresult, this group of PHEV owners may be more reliant on their PHEV for short- as well as long-trips and thereby are more in-
centivized to use public chargers to make the maximum use of the electric range of their vehicle.
Among PHEV owners who chose to charge their vehicle at multiple locations during the 7-day span, the PHEV owners in the
Home-work group are like their BEV counterparts except they tend to use their vehicle for longer commutes. The PHEV owners in the
Home-public group are more likely to have L2 chargers at home and have lower electricity rate than the average PHEV owner. This
group of PHEV owners are less likely to have access to workplace charging. The Work- public group of PHEV owners are similar to the
comparable group of BEV owners. Lastly, the Allgroup is more likely to have young PHEV drivers with access to L2 charger at home
as well as chargers in their workplace. In terms of household characteristics, this group of PHEV drivers are more likely to have a
larger household size and more vehicles, but a lower number of drivers in the households. Along with L2 charger at home this group
of PHEV drivers are more likely to pay lower rate electricity at home.
Overall, the results of the two multinomial logit models show that infrastructure location choices are characterized by a range ofTable 2
Multinomial logistic regression results for BEV owners.
Note: the coe ﬃcients colored with blue were positively signi ﬁcant at the level of 0.05, and red were negatively related at the level of 0.05.J.H. Lee, et al. Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249
10factors including socio-demographic characteristics like gender, income, and home ownership; vehicle characteristics like range and
age of the vehicle; commute distance; electricity rate paid at home; and access to charging facility at home and workplace.
Availability of workplace chargers plays an important role in determining the infrastructure use pattern, particularly when free. As
the results of the logistic regression show, renters, apartment/condominium dwellers with limited or nonexistent charging at home do
use their BEV for commuting when workplace charging is available. Other PEV users with charging facilities at home also use
workplace charging infrastructure especially when the residential electricity rate is high or workplace charging is free. Interestingly,
commute distance is a signi ﬁcant factor only for PHEV owners. As observed in Table 3, longer commute distance in PHEVs has a
positive e ﬀect on the mixed use of charging infrastructure for PHEV owners, like Home-Work andWork- Public and a negative e ﬀect
onWork only charging group. Assuming PHEV owners want to increase their proportion of electric miles, reduce the vehicle operating
cost, and reduce tailpipe emissions, they may want to charge their vehicles more often. Consequently, if drivers commute distance is
longer they seem more motivated to seek out additional charging opportunities.
Multiple case studies have discussed the importance of public infrastructure for residents of multi-unit dwellings ( Peterson,
2011) ).To control for this e ﬀect, we interact dwelling type of respondents i.e. whether the respondent resides in an apartment
complex with the availability of L2 public chargers within 300 m of residence for PHEV owners. For BEV owners, we explore theinteraction between dwelling type and availability of L2 and DC Fast public chargers within 300 m of residence. We observe that
there is no signi ﬁcant eﬀect on the choice of charging location for most of the charging behavior groups. It is signiﬁ cant and positive
for only the Work-Public group among BEV owners. Since this group is characterized by BEV owners living in apartments with lowerlikelihood of access to L2 charger at home but free workplace charging, public chargers near the multi-unit dwelling can play an
important role in satisfying their charging needs. Among PHEV owners, availability of L2 chargers within 300 m have a negligible but
signiﬁcant eﬀect for the Work-only (positive e ﬀect) and the Home-work group (negative e ﬀect). One potential reason for the overall
lack of signi ﬁcant eﬀect of public charger availability near multi-unit dwelling can be that BEV and PHEV owners may self-select into
apartment complexes where charging infrastructure is available in the complex parking facilities and therefore don ’t have to rely on
public infrastructure for vehicle charging. We also perform sensitivity analysis to consider the impact of public chargers within 500 mof residence and 1 mile of a residence. We do not ﬁnd any impact of public infrastructure on the choice of charging location by
households. Though the exploratory analysis involving only the spatial distribution of charging location indicated an impact of urbandensity, when we controlled for all the other factors inﬂ uencing charging behavior, we did not ﬁnd a signi ﬁcant e ﬀect of urban
density on BEV or PHEV owners.

115. Conclusion
In this paper, we used results from a 7-day charging behavior survey to capture variation in charging patterns among PEV owners.
Based on the use of di ﬀerent levels of chargers at di ﬀerent locations, we could analyze week-long patterns of charging behavior for
BEV and PHEV owners. Although there is negligible daily variation in the charging during weekdays, di ﬀerent charging patterns for
weekdays and weekends among BEV and PHEV owners were identi ﬁed. Using the charging data, we classi ﬁed survey takers into
seven di ﬀerent groups of PEV owners based on their charging patterns. 37.8% of the BEVs and 30.5% of the PHEVs use more than one
location and, in many cases, di ﬀerent charging powers over the week. However, both BEV and PHEV owners relied heavily on home
charging, with more than half of them only using home chargers. This highlights the ﬁndings of previous studies that found home
location charging to be the most important and most frequently used location. In terms of choice of the charging infrastructure, PHEV
owners were found to be dependent on L1 chargers at home about three times more than BEV owners. This may be due to the current
vehicles having smaller capacity batteries that can charge fully overnight on level 1.
Using a set of multinomial logit models, we analyzed potential factors that may characterize di ﬀerent charging patterns. Socio-
demographic characteristics like household income, home ownership, and gender of the driver, PEV characteristics like electric range
and age of the vehicle, travel behavior, electricity cost at home, workplace charging availability and accessibility to L2 charger at
home were found to be the key factors in ﬂuencing the infrastructure use patterns. Commute distance is a crucial factor for mixed
usage of charging infrastructure among PHEV owners, indicating that PHEV drivers who reside far from their workplace are morelikely to use workplace charging along with other options, allowing them to maximize the use of the electric range of the vehicle.
Current PEV infrastructure models are often developed to investigate home, work, or public charging events in isolation. The
results here show that the use of these three infrastructure types is interconnected, some owners display more mixed-use of the
charging infrastructure than others. This highlights the importance of having an integrated infrastructure investment plan that will
account for di ﬀerent locational charging patterns among PEV owners.
5.1. Policy implications
The results of this study show that home is the most frequently used charging location for PEV owners. Supporting the devel-
opment of home location charging should be an important consideration for policymakers, particularly in multi-unit dwellings and
those without o ﬀstreet parking. PEV adopters living in apartments are at present mostly dependent on workplace and public in-
frastructure. As the PEV market moves along the di ﬀusion curve from early adopters living in detached homes with the ﬂexibility to
install chargers at home to the early and late majority adopters ( Lee et al., 2019) the importance of chargers in multi-unit dwellings
will increase. However providing universal access to charging to residents in multi-unit dwelling may be challenging. The results of
the logit model show that workplace charging is used more frequently by multi-unit dwelling residents than any other non-home
charging location, including DC Fast public charging. In other words, for people without home charging level 2 workplace charging
can be a viable alternative. Level 2 work charging is also important for BEV owners who only have level 1 charging at home,
reinforcing the importance of this charging location. Development of workplace charging could in some regions enable the grid to
align load demand with supply of solar energy from distributed and utility-scale photovoltaic cells. In 2018, California State Gov-
ernment changed the building codes and made solar cells mandatory for all new construction. Utilities have expressed concern about
the proposition, particularly in relation to the ‘duck curve ’problem –the imbalance between peak demand and renewable energy
production. Considering workplace as a frequently used charging location, using appropriate pricing mechanisms commuters can beincentivized to plug-in their vehicle at a time when electricity production from solar energy is maximum.
One interesting result in this study is that more owners of 200-mile plus range BEVs like Tesla BEVs and the Chevrolet Bolt charge
only at home. This may have implications for the future development of non-home PEV charging infrastructure. At present infra-
structure planning decisions are often made with data from 100 miles BEVs, as they were the dominant PEV in the market. These
vehicles are more reliant on work and public chargers. However, in the recent past, all but one of these BEVs has been taken from the
market by automakers. Longer range BEVs look set to become the majority of BEVs on the roads in future years and these vehicles
may have a reduced or di ﬀerent need for the infrastructure.
5.2. Future research
Understanding location-based infrastructure use is insightful for planning purposes. It is also important for researchers to consider
charging behavior beyond diurnal trends. As our study shows there are di ﬀerences in charging behavior during the week and the
weekend. In particular, there are di ﬀerences in the number of workplace charging events during the weekend, which is not sur-
prising. However, we didn ’tﬁnd a signi ﬁcant di ﬀerence in DC fast charging during the week and the weekend. One reason could be
that BEV owners at present potentially use another vehicle for weekend travel (as they mostly all have an ICE vehicle). In future, moreDC fast charging events may emerge during the weekend partially due to longer range BEVs entering the market and because of
expanding DC fast charging infrastructure. Understanding this trend will be important for developing PEV charging infrastructure
thatﬁts
all travel behavior needs, not just the most frequently made trips (e.g. commuting).
The results in this study are from self-reported charging behavior of PEV owners in the week prior to taking the survey. As the
data is self-reported for a speci ﬁc 7-day period it is possible that for some respondents it does not fully align with their usual charging
behavior. For example, the week prior to taking the survey could have been an anomaly meaning the information we have is notrepresentative of a typical week. However, as the sample is large, we believe the data represents typical charging behavior for PEVJ.H. Lee, et al. Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249
12owners on an average. To address this limitation future studies should measure consumers ’actual charging behavior, potentially by
using data loggers installed on PEVs. Also, 8.9% of PHEV owners in this study do not charge their vehicles at all. A future study will
investigate this behavioral pattern in more detail to understand what factors lead to PHEV owners ’decision to not charge their
vehicle.
Overall, the classi ﬁcation of PEV owners based on their charging behavior and identi ﬁcation of the characteristics of the mixed
users of charging infrastructure lays down the foundation for future research on infrastructure planning for PEV charging, pricing ofelectricity, and, other policy questions. In the future, we would like to model the choice of charging infrastructure considering the
cost of charging and nature of commute trips as factors. We also plan to estimate the e ﬀect of associated policies like the promotion of
distributed solar on the cost of PEV charging and thereby the choice of charging infrastructure.
