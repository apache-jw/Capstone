Monte CarloABSTRACT
Travel pattern of an electric vehicle (EV) user and the accuracy of their probability distribution models are the
key factors affecting the simulation and prediction of EV charging load. Most of the existing works utilized the
travel data for all kinds of populations and ignored the influence of people social attributes on their travelpattern, which deteriorates the accuracy of the charging load model. This paper demonstrates that the daily EV
charging load profilesvary withdifferent demographicandsocialattributesbypresentinga refined EVcharging
load simulation method considering people’s demographics and social characteristics, e.g. gender, age, educa-tion level. First, to improve the fitting accuracy of people travel pattern, new probabilistic models of manydefinedspatial–temporalvariablesareestablishedunderrefinedconditions(i.e.location,daytype,etc.).Second,

1. Introduction
Due to urban environmental pollution and the global energy crisis,
many governments have set ambitious goals for the development of
electric vehicles (EVs) [1], resulting in rapid growth for EVs worldwide
[2]. France and UK have announced to stop sales of petrol and dieselautomobilesby 2040.Denmarkhasproposed abanon thesaleofdiesel
and petrol vehicles from 2030 and hybrid from 2035. However, many
studies have shown that a large number of EVs will require a con-
siderableamountofchargingelectricity [3,4]andsignificantlyincreasethe peak load and randomness on the demand side [5], which increase
the expenditures on the capacity expansion and operational pressure of
the distribution networks [6,7]. To alleviate the above issues, it is of
importance to simulate and predict the EV charging load reliably.
Most existing works established the simulation and prediction
model based on various data mining algorithms and primarily threekinds of datasets. (1)Historical charging records collected from public
charging infrastructure [8-13]and private charging outlets [14-16], in

Tcongestion index [17], traffic network data [18-20], GIS data [18],
CCTV data [19]. Weather data [21,22]were also used to simulate their
impacts on the driving distance and cycles [23], vehicle driving dy-
namics[24], and therefore to improve the accuracy of the subsequent
EVchargingloadsimulationandforecasting [25].(3)Cartravelrecords
from the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) [26-28]and
GPS data [29,30], including driving time, duration, distance, and des-
tinations. Currently, this method has been becoming the mainstream
category because of the reliability and easier availability of such data.
Many previous works of this method focused on developing probabil-
istic models of vehicle driving patterns and utilized various stochastic
algorithms to simulate the driving and charging events at different lo-
cations and times, e.g. Monte Carlo [31-34], Markov chain [35], kernel
density estimation [36], state-space model [37]. The EV charging load
canbepredictedifthe forecastofEV travelbehaviour isavailable [26].
However, the reliability of this method is restricted by the re-
presentativeness and accuracy of the probabilistic distribution models.
Existing research shows that people of different ages, incomes, and
educational background have different working and living patterns
[38,39],whichleadstodifferenttravelmodeandenergyconsumptions.
For instance, an individual’s occupation will significantly affect the
departuretimeofthedailytripandtheirparkingtime [3]aswellasthe
peak load of the daily load profile [40]. Few studies have been refining
theimpactsofdemographicsonthetravelpattern,whichbringshidden
errors to the charging load simulation.
To fill the research gap, this paper presents a simulation method for
the daily EV charging load based on the travel pattern and demo-
graphics of car user. Probabilistic models of several spatial–temporalvariables are established according to different day type and locations
to improve model accuracy. With the consideration of different char-
ging preference and power consumption rate, the daily profile of EV
charging load is simulated using Monte Carlo method. In the end, ty-
pical EV load profiles for various user groups (e.g. male, female, highly
educated and low educated population, etc.) are provided and com-
pared. The results show that the user's demographic and social attri-
butes have a considerable effect on the magnitude and peak time of the
EV charging load profile.
The rest of the paper is organized as follow. Section II demonstrates
the travel pattern of different populations, which is the foundation of
this work. Section III proposes the overall framework of the charging
load profile simulation considering user classification. Section IV de-
fines the variables of spatial–temporal travel characteristics and pre-
sents their refined modelling methods to improve the fitting accuracy.

consumption rate, etc. Section VII uses the NHTS survey data to vali-

2. Travelcharacteristicsofdifferentdemographicgroups
Different people have different working and living modes and
therefore have different travel characteristics. And, this will sig-
nificantly affect the spatial–temporal distribution of the charging load.

2this section, the travel data for different user groups are analyzed in
terms of both time and space dimensions to understand the travel
patterns of different populations better. The demographic attributes
considered and their classifications are shown in Table 1.
The departure time of the first trip, the end time of the daily trip,
andthedailytravellingdistanceareselectedtocomparethedailytravel
behaviour of different EV user groups. The U.S. NHTS dataset is taken
asanexample [41],asshownin Fig.1-Fig.3.Ingeneral,thedailytravel
of different groups has their characteristics; thereby, it is necessary to
consider the differences between various populations in the modelling
of travel pattern.
It can be seen from Fig. 1the departure time of the first trip for
young and middle-aged people is concentrated at around 7:00 am
during the workday, which is consistent with the commuting time of
students and office workers. The departure time for the elderly is
generally later and more flexible, ranging from 7:00 am to 11:00 am,
which is also in line with the lifestyle of retired older adults. A similar
rule applies to the end time of daily travel. Young adults tend to arrive
home from 16:00 to 18:00, while the arrival time of the elderly is
widely distributed from 11:00 am to 18:00. As shown in Fig. (c), the
elderly have shorter daily travelling distance, which can be attributed
to the physical and psychological condition of the elderly.
Fig. 2shows that the time for the relatively low-level educated
peoplegoingtoandgettingoffworkismoredispersedcomparedtothat
for the other people; moreover, more people leave for work at noon or
during midnight as well as get off work at very early daytime or during
midnight than the higher-educated people. This might be because
peoplewithlowereducationlevelsusuallyperformunstablejobs. Fig.3
shows that the males’ attendance time is generally earlier than that offemales and their daily driving distance is also longer.
3. ChargingloadprofilesimulationconsideringUsers’
demographics
As demonstrated above, EV users with different demographic
characteristics show distinct travel modes, which affects the profile
shape and magnitude of the charging load. To improve the re-
presentativeness of the travelling models and therefore the accuracy of
the charging load simulation, the charging load model should be es-
tablished for various user categories according to their demographics
(e.g. gender, education background, age). This section clarifys the
overallframeworkofthemethodologytosimulatetheEVchargingload
profile for different vehicle user categories.
Taking one demographic attribute (gender) as an example, the
method of modelling the typical charging load curves for male/female
users is described. Fig. 4shows the main process as well as the input
and output at each stage. The typical curves of the other user groups
can be derived by analogizing the following steps.
1). Filter the travel data according to the demographics of each user,
e.g. male/female.
2). Taking the filtered data as input, establish the probabilistic models
ofalldefinedspatial–temporaltravellingvariables(i.e.startingtime
of the first travel, driving time, parking time and driving distance)
for male/female users. The modelling method of the probabilistic
travelling models was explained in Section IV, and the detailed
probabilistic models used for different variables and user categories
are shown in Table 2.
3). Taking the above probabilistic models as input, use the methods
presentedinSectionVandVItosimulatethetravelbehavioraswell
astheenergyconsumptionandchargingeventsduringthedailytrip
with additional consideration on day type, location type, charging
preference and the rate of battery energy consumption. Then, a
given number of samples (charging load curves) are generated for
male/female users. Note that the number of generated samples can
be changed according to the number of EV users and demographicsin the simulated area.
4). Averageandnormalizethecurvesofmale/femaleuserstoeliminate
the effects of abnormal loads, the simulation number, and the unit
of load on typical curves. The min–max normalization is adopted as
shown in (1)

where
xt is the charging load at the time tafter normalization; xtis the
original charging load at time t;
xtmin. and
xtmax are the minimum and
maximum values of the charging load time series, respectively. To fa-
cilitate the curve comparison, the minimum and maximum values are
taken as the same. Modelling Method of Travel Characteristics
4. Modellingmethodoftravelcharacteristics
The user's travel characteristics are an essential input for simulating
the EV charging load. Different driving behaviours have a profound
impact on the location and duration of a charging event. For example,
an increase in driving time duration will lead to an increase in EV en-
ergy consumption and longer charging time; driving to different desti-
nations will change the spatial distribution of the charging load.
Therefore, accurate modelling of travel features is a crucial part of the
entire charging load simulation process. This section proposes a gen-
erally adaptive modelling method for the probabilistic models of tra-
velling time–space variables, laying a foundation for the subsequent
development of EV charging load models for different user groups.
In this paper, the accuracies of the probabilistic distribution models
of all travel variables are improved by using various algorithms, in-
cludingBurrTypeXII,Lognormal,Stable,Normal,GeneralizedExtreme
Value (GEV), Weibull, Exponential, Gamma, Birnbaum-Saunders,
Inverse Gaussian, Loglogistic, Logistic, Nakagami, Rician, and t
Location-Scale (tLS) distribution. The above algorithms can cover a
wide range of distribution shapes and satisfy the diversity of distribu-
tion patterns in various defined travel variables. For example, the
Normal curve is bell-shaped, low at both tails, high in the middle, and
left–right symmetrical. The Logistic distribution has a longer tail and a
higher kurtosis than the normal distribution. The Inverse Gaussian, the
Lognormal and the Nakagami distribution are used to model right-
skewed, non-negative data. The Stable distribution and the t Location-
Scale distribution are suitable for modelling heavy tails (more prone to
outliers).TheExponentialdistributionisaparticularcaseofthegamma
distribution, and it is useful in modelling events that occur randomly
over time. The Burr distribution includes many commonly used dis-
tributions such as gamma, lognormal, loglogistic, bell-shaped, and J-
shaped beta distributions (but not U-shaped).
The selected distribution models are used to fit a given variable
respectively, and the model which performs best is determined as the
adopted one. The evaluation indexes of the model accuracy are the
coefficient of determination R2and the corrected coefficient of de-
termination
Ra2 as shown in (2–3).

A. Probability Distribution Fitting of Time Variables
In this paper, probability distributions of three temporal variables
(starting time of the first trip in a day, the time duration of the car
driving and car parking) are fitted to quantify the temporal character-
isticsofthedailydrivingtrip.Firstly,thestartingtimeofthefirsttripis
fitted. Secondly, the time duration of the car driving is classified ac-
cording to the starting place and trip destination; noted that the prob-
ability distributions of different categories are fitted respectively.
Finally, the time duration of the car parking is classified according to
the type of parking place, and the probability distributions of different
groups are fitted respectively.

4Driving time duration is classified into eight categories according to
the locations (two types of starting place multiply two types of ending
place) and workday/weekend. Eight types of driving time are shown in
Table 3. Eight types of driving time are separately fitted using the
lognormal distribution with different fitting parameters.
3). Time duration of the car parking -
Tp
Parking time limits the length of the charging period and charging
load, and affects the following destination. For example, if the parking
time is short and the charging energy demand is high, the car user willprefer to select the fast charging mode; and, if the parking time and
charging time is extended, there probably will be more destination
options because of being able to drive to farther destinations.
According to the types of parking places and workday/weekend,
parking time is divided into six categories. Distribution models of six
kinds of parking time are shown in Table 4.
B. Conditional Probability Distribution of Driving Distance
In this paper, driving distance dis regarded as obeying the prob-
ability distribution under the condition of driving time. According to
the same classification way as driving time, driving mileage is also
divided into eight categories. Eight types of driving distance in the i-th
time window are separately fitted using Normal distribution. The con-
ditional probability density function is shown in (5).

C. Spatial Transition Probability

driving from destination
Dm to the next destination

timeslot.Assumedthatthecurrentdestination

5. Travelbehavioursimulation
In this paper, Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the travel
behaviours of car users [42]. The corresponding probabilistic models
for a given population are taken as model inputs including the discrete
spatial transition probability matrix and probability distribution of all
defined spatial–temporal travelling variables. All the variables are
sampled sequentially, thereby the daily driving trip of each user can be
obtained.
1). The starting time of the first trip is sampled based on the corre-
sponding distribution under the condition that the starting place of
the first trip is home.
2). With the gained starting time, the destination is sampled by the
corresponding spatial transition probability under the condition ofthe known starting time and starting place.
3). With the gained destination, the driving time is sampled by the
corresponding distribution under the condition of the obtained
starting place and trip destination. According to the starting time of

5driving and the driving time duration, the ending time of driving is
calculated.
4). With the obtained driving time, the driving distance is sampled by
the corresponding distribution under the condition of the time
duration of driving.
5). The parking time is sampled by the corresponding distribution
under the condition of the obtained trip destination. According to
theendingtimeofdrivingandparkingduration,thestartingtimeofthe next trip is calculated for simulating next trip.
6. Chargingpreferenceandchargingloadsimulation
Based on the simulated travelling behaviours of each users, the
charging load profiles can be simulated [42]. To improve the load si-
mulation accuracy, the charging preference is considered during theload simulation. Two types of charging behaviours are designed.
1). A conservative charging preference
EV charging would be started when the is met. This means that EV
users will charge their cars when the remaining energy in the EV bat-
teries is unable to support the energy consumption of the next trip.
+ E w d C 0.2 m end n m, 1
(8)
where
Em end, is the remaining energy (kW·h) in the EV battery when
arriving at the m-th trip destination;
wn is the energy consumption per
kilometer (kW·h/km) of the n-th car; 0.2C (kW·h) is the lower limit of
remaining energy in an EV battery.
2). A positive charging preference
EVs will be charged regardless of whether or not is satisfied.
The charging load is calculated by combining the charging as-
sumptions with the sampled travel process. Take a specific trip of a
vehicle as an example, the simulation process is illustrated below and
shown in Fig. 5.
1) The energy consumption of this trip is calculated by multiplying theTable2

2) TheSOCoftheEVbatteryisupdatedwhenthevehiclestopsdriving.
3) The charging preference and the subsequent journey of the EV
driver determines whether the car will be charged once it is parked
at this simulation iteration or waits until the remaining electricity
cannot supply the next trip.
4) If charged, the charging power can be determined according to the
type of parking location.
5) The charging time duration of this parking event is calculated by
dividing the energy consumption by the charging power and also
constrained by the parking time limit.
6) The SOC of the EV battery is updated again when the car leaves the
parking place.
7) Repeat the step 1 to 6, the charging time duration and charging
power of each parking event in a day for one vehicle are calculated.
Thetimeseriesofchargingloadofthisvehicleineachparkingplace

8) Repeat the step 1 to 7, the daily load profiles of a given number of
EVs in different places can be simulated. The regional charging load
profile can be calculated by aggregating the profiles for all the ve-
hicles..
7. Casestudy
A. Data discription and model assumption
This paper assumes that the travel mode of EV users is the same as
that of fuel vehicle users. Data used in the case study come from thetravel data packet in the U.S. NHTS in 2009 [41]. In this data packet,
travel information of each trip for each car during a day is recorded,including starting and ending time, driving time, driving distance andparking time. It also includes the demographic information of the re-spondents (e.g. gender, age, education, occupation, income, etc.),
which is the basis for distinguishing each type of user. According to the
statistics of the data, it is assumed that each car user can make up to
three trips a day.
In this paper, some parameters are assumed in the simulation,
which is not always accurate in reality. The energy consumption rates
and capacity of each EV are randomly selected from a specific range
according to current battery technology. The charging power and the
number of EVs in a region are assumed to be constant. However, these
parameters can be modified easily if real-world data are available. The
specific values of the parameters in the case are set as follows.
1). 100,000 EVs are simulated.
2). the energy consumption rate of each EV is randomly set to
0.1 ~ 0.25 kW·h/km, the capacity of each EV battery is randomly
chosen from 40 ~ 50 kW·h, and the initial SOC is 0.8C.
3). considering the battery degradation due to over-charging or over-
discharging, the upper and lower limits of SOC are set to 0.2 and
0.8, respectively.
4). the charging power in the W, O, H1 region is 8 kW, while in H2
region is 4 kW [43].
B. Probability Distribution of Time Variables
1). Starting time of the first trip
Tofitthestartingtimeof thefirsttrip, threedistributionmodelsare
proposed and compared. Table 5. shows the used distribution models
Fig.5.Process of simulating the charging load.J. Zhang, et al. Applied Energy 274 (2020) 115063
7and their performances. It is found that the Burr Type XII distribution
works the best. And, the coefficient of determination and the corrected
coefficient of determination for the Burr Type XII distribution is higher
than that for other distributions by over 10%, for both workday and
weekend.
The probability distributions of the starting time of the first trip for
different day types are showed in Fig. 6. For workday, the fitting
parameters are: α= 7.986, C = 6.696, K = 0.609. For weekend, the
fittingparametersare: α=11.46,C=5.79,K=1.24.Asshowninthe
Fig. 6, the probability distributions of the starting time of the first trip
between workday and weekend are different. Distribution on workday
is mainly around 8:00 am, which coincides with the real-world situa-
tion. And, the distribution on weekend is mainly concentrated around
10:00 am, which is in line with people's weekend schedule.
2). Driving time duration
The probability distributions of eight types of driving time are
shown in Fig. 7andFig. 8respectively. It is observed that the driving
time for both workday and weekend obey the lognormal distribution
well. The differences in the distributions of different types of driving
time for the same day type are obvious. The fitting parameters for
workday and weekend are shown in (9) and (10), respectively.

3). Parking time
Considering different parking places and different day types, the
performance of different distribution models for parking time is shown
inTable 6. and Table 7. Nearly all the distibutions achieved above 0.9
fitting accuracy. The best fit appears to the distribution of W place andO place on workday, whose coefficient of determination and the cor-
rected coefficient of determination are higher than that of the other
benchmarks by over 0.35. Distributions of parking time for different
places on workday/weekend are shown in Fig. 9andFig. 10respec-
tively. Itis suggested thatthedistributionsare well fittedexcept fortheones of the workplace.
ForWplaceonworkday,thefittingparametersare α=1.324, β=-
0.51,γ= 66.379, δ= 535.77.
For H place on workday, the fitting parameters are α = 3032.83,
C= 1.043, K= 27.171.
For O place on workday, the fitting parameters are k= 0.765,
σ= 35.419, μ= 63.477.
For W place on weekend, the fitting parameters are μ= 461.059,
σ= 191.418.
For H place on weekend, the fitting parameters are a= 169.309,b= 1.133.
For O place on weekend, the fitting parameters are α = 53.199,
C= 4.619, K= 0.305.
C. Spatial Transition Probability Matrix
Spatial transition probability matrixes for the two randomly se-
lected time periods on workday/weekend are shown in Fig. 11. As
shown in the figure, the trip destination is closely related to the tra-velling time period. And, the spatial transition probabilities for
workday and weekend are different during morning rush hours but are
almost the same during evening rush hours.
D. Impacts of Charging Preference on Charging Load
In this section, the distributions of charging load at different energy
consumption rates (energy consumption per kilometer) for the twotypes of charging preference are shown in Fig. 12. To clarify the sen-
sitivity of energy consumption rate and charging preference on thecharging load, the charging load needed for the trip driving from H2 to
W are demonstrated as an example. Taking the point (10–20, 6) on the
curve as an example, it means that for EV users whose commuting
duration is 10 to 20 min, their demand for charging in this trip reaches
6 × 10
4kW.
As shown in the figure, for the conservative charging preference,
energy consumption rate has a significant impact on the charging load
distribution. Meanwhile, for the positive charging preference, the en-
ergy consumption rate has very limited impacts on the charging load,
and the demand for charging is much higher than the conservative
charging. This might be because EVs would becharged once arriving at
the destinations, and the driving distance of each trip and the desti-
nation type would have larger impacts on the charging load demands
than the energy consumption rate.
Note that, according to the probability distribution of driving time,
driving time is mainly between 10 and 20 min. Therefore, for the
second type of charging preference, the charging load of EVs with the
driving time of 10–20 min is significantly higher than the rest driving
time. However, for the first type of charging preference, the driving
time duration with the highest charging load is not 10–20 min but
60–70 min. More importantly, the charging load for the driving time of
10–20 min is reduced, which is good to the grid, because a car with aTable5

E. Daily Charging Load Profiles for different user groups
Theabove resultsshow thatthe proposedsimulation method is able
to simulate the probabilistic models and charging load accurately.
Based on the above results, this section attempts to provide the daily
charging load profiles for different user groups.
Fig. 13toFig. 15are typical charging load profiles for different age
groups, gender groups, and educationgroups. Theresults show thatthe
typical profiles of different user populations have large differencesunder certain conditions (e.g. workday, office areas), which proves thenecessity of considering population classification in this paper. Fig. 13
toFig. 15can be found in Appendix.
Ascanbeseenfrom Fig.13,theageoftheEVusershasasignificant
impact on the shape, peak and peak time of the load profile, especiallyon weekdays and office areas. This is caused by the difference of
working and living patterns of various age groups.
1). On weekdays and H1 region, the load profile of elderly people
shows a single sharp peak, and the peak appears at noon – 12:00.
This might because the elderly people have more time staying at
home during the daytime. The load profiles of users of other ages
show double peaks at around 10:00–11:00 and 16:00. This might
because the young people go home for lunch break and dinner and

9thenleaveforworkorplay.Theirpeaksarelowerthanthatofolder
users, with a maximum difference of 41%.
2). On weekdays and in the H2 region, the peak of load profile of the
elderly users is advanced by 16%, while the peak value is reduced
by 10%. This coincides with the lifestyle of the elderly people, who
tends to return home earlier than the others. In addition, load
profile of older adults have lower peak because they normally re-
turn home at flexible times, resulting in random time of charging.
3). In the W region, the higher the age of the users is, the lower the
charging demand they require. In particular, the daily total char-
ging load of elderly users is extremely lower than that of the
younger users by up to 77%. This might because the older users are
less active and drive less, which is related to factors concerning
physical strength and mentality.
Fig. 14shows that the shapes of the charging load profile for males
and females are similar. However, the charging demand of males ishigher than that of females, and the difference is even larger on the
weekend, reaching 46% in the H1 region. Due to physical differences,male users are more tolerance to long-distance driving and more likely
to travelling out on the weekends.
Fig. 15shows that the difference in education levels are mainly
reflected in the load profiles for the commuting regions (i.e. H2 and W
region), while the differences in magnitude and shape of the profiles in
other regions are very small. In the H2 region, the evening rush hours
for the high-educated people are later than the low-educated people,
which are 20:00 and 16:00, respectively. In the W area, the charging
demand of the highly educated population is significantly higher than
that of the low educated population (up to 32%), and has a much clear
morning peak. It might be for the reasons that, highly educated people
are generally more willing to work hard, and low educated people al-
ways have more irregular working hours.
8. Conclusions
In this paper, an EV charging load simulation method is proposed
based on users’ demographics, refined probabilistic distribution models
of temporal-spacial travel mode and other additional factors, including
charging preference and energy consumption rate. Different from tra-
ditional methods, the proposed method utilizes refined probabilistic
modelswith consideration of daytypeand location aswell as the users’
demographics to improve the simulation accuracy. Based on the im-
proved method, the typical daily profiles for various user groups are
provided.Theresultsinthecasestudyvalidatetheproposedmodeland
compare the load profiles of various categories of EV users.
•The demographics of EV users have a significant effect on the
magnitudeand peaktimeofthe dailycharging load, particularlyfor
workdays and workplace.
•The accuracy of the probability distribution models of various spa-
tial–temporal variables is improved by considering additional re-
fined conditions. The fitting performance evaluation index reach up
to 0.9739 and 0.9725.
•The daily charging load profiles for different types of chargingpreferences and differentenergy consumption rates are significantly
diverse, indicating the necessity for considering these factors during
charging load modeling.
Future works are worthy of exploring in several aspects:
1). DifferentdemographicshaveauniquewayofadaptingEVuses,e.g.
the tolerance to low SOC and the preference for vehicle type, which

further improve the accuracy of simulating the daily charging load
profile.
