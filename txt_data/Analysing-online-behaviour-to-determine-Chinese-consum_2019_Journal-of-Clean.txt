While prior studies of consumer preferences on electric vehicles (EVs) utilized stated preference (SP) or
revealed preference (RP) data, this study examined consumer preferences for EVs through their online
behaviour. Using big data and text mining technologies to explore large quantities of Chinese consumers ’
online behaviour pertaining to EV selection, comparison, purchase inquiry, and comments, we found thatEV prices, car classi ﬁcation and powertrain types were the most important factors in ﬂuencing consumer
response. In addition to general interests, we also noted application speci ﬁc interests. For instance, we
observed a preference for small battery electric vehicle (BEV) models with fast-charging batteries, which
are well-suited to work commutes and daily life. By contrast, when examining plug-in hybrid electricvehicles (PHEVs), we noticed that consumers expressed a preference for sport utility vehicle (SUV)
models. Finally, we found that in addition to price and technical speci ﬁcations, EV aesthetics play a
signiﬁcant role in consumer choice. These conclusions are valuable for government agencies and EV
manufacturers looking to promote EVs and address environmental pollution by appealing to consume
interests.

1. Introduction
Compared to internal combustion engine vehicles (IECVs),
electric vehicles (EVs)1can reduce CO 2emissions, produce zero
tailpipe emissions and emit little noise ( Peng et al., 2016 ). Pro-
moting EVs will help achieve the carbon reduction targets of the
Paris Agreement while effectively reducing urban air and noise
pollution ( IEA, 2017 ). Several countries are vigorously promoting
the production and adoption of EVs. As the world's largest con-
sumer market for EVs, China's results in promoting EVs areparticularly outstanding. By the end of June 2018, China's EV
ownership ranked ﬁrst in the world dreaching 1.99 million units
(MOPS, 2018 ).
How to make consumers pay attention to, accept, purchase and
use EVs is an important topic for governments and EVmanufacturers alike. To address this topic, it is necessary to study
consumer preferences for EVs, which includes identifying the
various factors that in ﬂuence consumers ’choices of EVs. With this
information, the government can formulate corresponding public
policies to promote EV promotion, and manufactures can deter-
mine the direction of their production and investment to promote
EV sales.
Many of the studies which have researched the factors and
preferences affecting consumers ’purchase of EV in recent years
explored the issue from two main directions: stated preferencesand revealed preferences. To some extent, these two research
methods may not fully re ﬂect the true perspective of consumers
because of the data sources they used.
Due to the short time of EV promotion, most research is based
on questionnaires or experiments to identify consumers' responses
and/or behaviours. The conclusions are based on subjective state-
ments of intention, which are collected from a questionnaire in an
assumed situation or experiment designed by the researcher(s).
These subjective statements of intention indicate the consumer's
preferences ( Bishop, 1990 ;Cummings and Taylor, 1999 ), and the
process of determining preferences by examining subjective*Corresponding author.

stated preference, the core of revealed preference theory is to infer
preferences from consumers' behaviour. In 1948, revealed prefer-
ence was proposed by Paul Samuelson (1948) , who believed that
the real purchase behaviour of consumers under certain price
constraints shows their true inherent consumption propensity, and
the investigator can infer the consumer's preference through the
customer's actual purchase behaviour. Colombo et al. (2008) argue
that this consumer preference, inferred by observing consumer
purchase behaviour, is more representative than consumer pref-
erences determined by hypothetical scenarios.
Although it seems that revealed preferences can approximate
consumers' true preferences, there are two problems in studying
Chinese consumers' revealed preferences for EVs. The ﬁrst is the
insufﬁcient empirical sales data, which results from a short devel-
opment time. Another point is that China restricts vehicle pur-
chases, thus preventing the sales data of EVs from fully re ﬂecting
consumers ’needs. The majority of EV sales in China are carried out
in large and medium-sized cities, while the governments in these
cities often issue different forms of vehicle purchase restriction
policies to control urban road congestion and air pollution ( Ma
et al., 2017 ). Although these restriction policies provide a certain
degree of privilege to the sale of EVs, they still suppress the sales of
EVs. For example, Beijing granted vehicle registration via a lottery
system to limit the increase in motor vehicles. Although the Beijing
government has exempted the license lottery regulations for EVs
and implemented the method of obtaining license plates as long as
consumers apply, the total number of license plates that can be
issued is still limited. In, 2017, a total of 150,000 new license plates
were issued in Beijing, including 90,000 ICEV licenses and
60,000 EV licenses ( MOT, 2017 ). However, at the end of 2017,
2,922,537 people in Beijing applied for ICEV license plates, and
123,980 people applied for EV license plates ( BTMB , 2017 ). That is
to say, because of the vehicle purchase restriction policy, market
transaction data cannot truly re ﬂect consumer demand.
Therefore, in this study, we did not use traditional stated or
revealed data, but adopted a novel data source ebig data, which is
consumers' online behaviour data on a car website. Consumers'
online behaviours, such as EV selection, comparison, submission of
purchase inquiry and post-purchase comment sharing on the car
website, which consumers made without being disturbed by any
researcher, were collected for an analysis of consumers ’preferences
for EV performance indicators and details as well as EV uses.
Big data maps human behaviour on the Internet ( Herzenstein
et al., 2011 ), which is an important reason big data has become a
research hotspot in the ﬁeld of information technology in recent
years. By analysing the behaviour of EV consumers in a big data
environment, the whole process of consumers' decision-making
can be observed from the perspective of consumers. Big data
overcomes the limitation of traditional stated preference research
(Büschken and Allenby, 2016 ), which often uses questionnaires and
other experiment methods, in terms of time and space attributes. In
the case of insuf ﬁcient sales data, big data provide an opportunity
to research consumers' revealed preferences. Combined with text
mining technology, we can extract potentially useful information
that users are interested in from massive user reviews and discoversome information that manual analysis may ignore ( Zarrinkalam
et al., 2018 ). Moreover, because the full sample is collected
directly from the network, the selected bias can be avoided.
Therefore, this paper uses big data of consumer online behaviour
combined with text mining technology to explore the preferences
of EV consumers from the consumer's perspective, under the
premise of ensuring the objectivity and comprehensiveness of
sample selection.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2presents thedecision-making factors determined in previous studies that affect
consumers ’purchase of EVs, and reviews the development of text
mining technology. Section 3describes the consumer online
behaviour data we collected from the car website. Section 4de-
scribes the calculation methods and data processing procedures
used in this article. Section 5details the results and the corre-
sponding discussion. Section 6concludes the article.
2. Literature review2.1. Consumers ’preferences for EVs
Most existing studies have found that external, environmental
factors affect consumers' purchases of EV. These factors include the
construction of charging stations ( Yu et al., 2016 ;Skippon et al.,
2016 ;Hardman et al., 2018 ), charging costs ( Zhang et al, 2018a ),
fuel prices ( Gnann et al., 2015 ;He et al., 2017 ), EV purchase sub-
sidies ( Lin and Wu, 2018 ), government incentive policies ( Zhang
et al, 2018b ), personal carbon trading ( Li et al., 2018 ), and family
car status ( Jensen and Mabit, 2017 ). There are also many studies
that consider consumers ’own demographic, situational and psy-
chological factors ( Li et al., 2017 ), such as lifestyles and habits
(Axsen et al., 2015 ), consumer acceptance of new products ( Morton
et al., 2016 ), environmental awareness, psychological needs ( Zhang
et al., 2013 ), perception and personality ( He et al., 2018 ).
These studies analyse diverse factors from different perspectives
that affect consumers' purchase of EVs, but only a small amount of
research is aimed at the speci ﬁcations and uses of EVs. In other
words, few studies consider the role of EVs ’own factors, such as
price and other speci ﬁcations that affect consumer choice. We
reviewed some studies which have targeted the impact of speci ﬁc
attributes of EVs on consumer choice, as shown in Table 1 .
Studying consumers' preferences for EVs' own speci ﬁcations is
useful for governments to make policy and manufacturers to design
products ( Li et al., 2019 ). Almost all of the studies listed in Table 1
are conducted by means of questionnaires and are explored from
a relatively single technical speci ﬁcation perspective. The studies
did not fully consider the consumers' preferences regarding the
EVs' speci ﬁcations, and the relationship between these speci ﬁca-
tions and the consumers' use of EVs were not explored in detail. In
this paper, consumers
’preferences for and uses of EVs are the focus
of our study(see Table 2 ).
2.2. Big data and text mining
Because consumers of EVs undergo a long decision-making
process, there is a lot of data that is dif ﬁcult to analyse. To accu-
rately obtain user preferences from massive network data, sup-
porting information processing technology is required. The use of
big data and text mining technology can avoid the defects caused
by the traditional manual extraction method ( Kim and Kang, 2018 ).
For example, with the traditional manual extraction method, the
selection of samples is affected by subjective factors, and the
sample size is smaller due to workload limitation.
The main purpose of this paper is to determine consumers'
preferences for and uses of EVs from an analysis of consumers ’EV
reviews online, so we extract information from the comment ob-
jects. Information extraction refers to using natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) and analysis techniques to extract entities,
relationships, time and other related content from massive text
data ( Sharma et al., 2010 ). Extracting the relationship between the
comment object and the comment word is the basis for mining the
deep value of the data, because a single comment may involve
multiple comment objects of different meanings, and a more ac-
curate analysis can be performed only after the comment object isS.-C. Ma et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 245determined. Relationship extraction has always been a research
hotspot in the ﬁeld of NLP and is now widely used in various pro-
fessional ﬁelds, such as the medical and automotive industries ( Hu
and Liu, 2004 ). Such industries often have a large number of pro-
fessional terms, and there are different types of relationships be-
tween these terms.
The study of information extraction has evolved from a
dictionary-based and rule-based approach ( Saif et al., 2012 ), as well
as a statistical machine learning-based approach ( Lu et al., 2011 ), to
a deep learning-based approach in recent years. The methods based
on statistical machine learning mainly include maximum entropy
(ME) ( Sriboonchitta et al., 2015 ) and conditional random ﬁelds
(CRF) ( Lafferty et al., 2001 ). These methods of semantic analysis are
based on semantic dictionaries, and they focus on the construction
of emotional dictionaries and the extraction of emotional words.
These analysis are also called emotional analysis on the semantic
level. This kind of method mainly extracts the semantic features of
the comment object by means of the upper and lower positions and
synonymous relations in the wordnet. However, in this paper, we
prefer to focus on the semantic features related to the comment
object. That is, we consider the close relationship between the
comment object and its domain information, and make full use of
the unique perspective of each domain datum to extract the
comment objects at the phrase level.
In recent years, deep learning tools, including convolutional
neural networks (CNN) ( Zeng et al., 2015 ), recurrent neural net-
works (RNN) ( Jason Alan Fries, 2016 ) and long short-term memory
(LSTM) ( Miwa and Bansal, 2016 ), have been extensively applied in
NLP. Deep learning is characterized by powerful sequence model-
ling capabilities, the ability to accurately capture contextualinformation and the ability of neural networks to ﬁt nonlinearities,
which are advantages over CRF. Among them, the LSTM based on
dependency parsing (DP) ( Buchholz and Marsi, 2006 ) has the
advantage of being able to obtain the relationship between samples
over a long time period. Moreover, the bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-
LSTM) ( Tourille et al., 2017 ) developed on the basis of LSTM can
more effectively acquire the features before and after the input
sentence. For example, in the word segmentation task, compared
with the traditional word segmentation algorithm, Bi-LSTM can
take advantage of two-way access to sentence features, and the
word segmentation effect effectively approximates the perception
of human cognition. However, due to the ﬂawed structure of the
original time-step model design, as the input sequence continues to
grow, the performance of Bi-LSTM worsens. Moreover, adding the
‘Attention model ’can make the task system more focused on
ﬁnding useful information related to the current output in the input
data, thus improving the quality of the output ( Zhou et al., 2016 ).
The principle of the Attention model is to preserve the intermediate
output of the LSTM pair of input sequences and to train a model to
selectively learn these inputs and associate the output sequences
with the model output.
LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-LSTM with attention module had been tested
on a same authoritative corpus, Stanford Natural Language Infer-
ence (SNLI) ( Bowman et al., 2015 ), for several times. And the per-
formance improvement from LSTM to Bi-LSTM, and to Bi-LSTM
with attention module are signi ﬁcant. The value of key perfor-
mance indicator Accuracy rose from 80.6 in the LSTM to 84.2 in the
Bi-LSTM, and rose to 86.8 in the Bi-LSTM with attention module
(Chen et al., 2017 ;Liu et al., 2016 ;Parikh et al., 2016 ).
In summary, this paper will use the dependency parsing theoryTable 1

consumers ’EV comments. In terms of feature extraction and se-
lection, the method adopted in this paper is the Bi-LSTM algorithm
combined with the Attention model to semantically analyse con-
sumer comment text. This method can effectively extract features
to represent text and improve recognition accuracy. At the same
time, based on the dependency parsing analysis, the word pair with
the grammatical relationship is extracted as a feature, and it is
possible to avoid using the same vector to represent sentences with
the same words but different grammatical structures.
3. Data collection
In order to obtain enough consumer behaviour data, we have
been working with Autohome,2China's largest auto website, for
more over a year since the end of 2016. Behavioural data of con-
sumers' browsing, comparing, submitting purchasing inquiry and
commenting on the Autohome website were collected to study
consumer preferences' for EVs. To facilitate understanding, we
simpli ﬁed the process of the consumers' operation on the Auto-
home website into three steps, as shown in Fig. 1 .
Theﬁrst step is the car selection process. Consumers choose
several EV models from a large number of models on the website.
Among these models, consumers can compare prices and perfor-
mance speci ﬁcations. When the consumer ﬁnds the model he/she
wants to buy, he/she can start the second step, which is to leave a
phone number on the Autohome website and submit a purchase
inquiry. The website will automatically send the contact informa-
tion of the consumer to all the dealers who sell the particular EV
nearby. The dealer will contact the consumer to inquire about thewillingness to purchase the EV and make an appointment to test
the EV of ﬂine. After the consumer completes the EV purchase, he/
she can choose to carry out the third step, which is to share his/her
experience with the EV by publishing a comment on the website
(this action is also known as ‘word of mouth ’). Consumers' com-
ments on EVs are unstructured textual data that contain all infor-
mation regarding the EV efrom its selection process to its use.
From these comments, we can obtain more subjective evaluation
information rather than objective performance parameters.
According to the three-step process, we collected the online
behaviour data of consumers as follows:If the consumers compare two EV models, then they are inter-
ested in both models. When the consumers do a performance
comparison, they are most likely concerned with the differences in
performance parameters between the two EVs. Therefore, match-
ing the comparison times with the compared EVs ’parameters will
yield meaningful results.
When a consumer submits a purchase inquiry for an EV on the
Autohome website, this indicates that he/she has a strong will-
ingness to purchase a particular EV, even though he/she may not be
able to purchase the model because of the purchase restriction
policy on vehicles. Because car salespeople begin to reach out to
whoever submits a purchase inquiry with several phone calls,
consumers do not easily leave their contact information. Therefore,
the purchase inquiry data can more accurately re ﬂect the con-
sumer's willingness to purchase an EV than the sales data, which
are suppressed due to the purchase restriction.
Compared with EV comparison data, voluntarily published
comment text after the purchase of a car contains more informa-
tion. We have selected two information points with research value
from the textual data of the comments: the details that affect the
ﬁnal decision and the purpose of buying a car. In a large number of
commentary texts, we found that many consumers mentioned why
consumers chose the EV between two or three models in the ﬁnal
stage of the purchase decision. For example, in the choice between
the EV iand the EV j, because the steering system of the EV iis
better than that of the EV j, the EV iis selected. So the steering
system is a detail that consumers value greatly. Moreover, this
result cannot be obtained by comparing the speci ﬁcations and price
data of EV iand EV j. Thus, this is invaluable information that re-
ﬂects the key factors consumers consider in the ﬁnal decision stage
before purchasing a car. Moreover, EV performance parameters,
such as driving experience and handling, cannot be expressed innumbers. We collected a total of 1046 comments related to the
details of the ﬁnal decision. Another point worth noting is that
consumers will provide the main purpose of the EV in comments.
These comments often include information, such as ‘the car cannot
travel long distances ’,‘the car is mainly useful for commuting in the
city ’and ‘the mileage of the car is mostly generated by weekend
outings. ’We collected a total of 25,070 comments related to why
the cars were purchased.
4. Methodology4.1. EV performance data processing
The study of consumers' EV preferences is divided into two
steps. First, it is necessary to identify the performance indicators
with which the consumers are most concerned based on the data of
consumers' EV comparison and EV speci ﬁcations. The second step
is to analyse the consumers' preference value for these perfor-
mance indicators using the consumers ’purchase inquiry data. The
speci ﬁc method is as follows.
In order to comprehensively examine the consumers' concerns
about EVs, 18 indicators are selected from the research results ofprevious scholars listed in Table 1 as potential concerns for con-
sumers to choose an EV. In addition to nine concerns about normal
vehicles, including the manufacturer's suggested retail price,
vehicle classi ﬁcation, brand nationality, number of seats, size
(length, width, height, wheelbase) and weight, there are also nine
unique characteristics of electric vehicles, including powertrain
type, and electri ﬁcation performance (battery type, battery capac-
ity, all-electric range, time of slow charging, whether it supports
fast charge, time of fast charging, motor type, total motor power).
Each of the above 18 speci ﬁcations has been proven by previous
scholars as a consumer's focus on EV. For the average consumer,
Fig. 1. The process of consumers buying a car in Autohome.
2Autohome ( https://www.autohome.com.cn ) is the most visited professional car
website in China. Its DAU (daily active users) reached 35 million. Autohome was
listed on the New York Stock Exchange on December 11, 2013, with the stock code,
‘ATHM ’.S.-C. Ma et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 247these indicators include almost all the factors that will affect their
purchase choice. So next we can analyse the consumer's attention
to each indicator.

the index fof all the EV models under comparison.
The order of the Afvalues is the order of the consumers' atten-
tion to various indicators. For the speci ﬁc indicator f, the preference
value is achieved by using the match between the data of the
consumers ’purchase inquiries and the EV performance parame-
ters. For numerical indicators, such as battery capacity, pure electricrange, etc., we calculate the preference value using the weighted
average method.

where Vﬁis the value of indicator fof the model i,Qiis the number
of people who have submitted a purchase inquiry for the EV model
i, and Qis the total number of people who have submitted a pur-
chase inquiry for the any EV models. This method is to use the data
of the consumers' purchase inquiries, instead of the EV sales dataused in the revealed preference research, to directly re ﬂect the
consumer's preference and make up for the defect that the EV sales
data cannot fully re ﬂect the consumer's willingness to purchase an
EV in China. For the performance indicators of textual data, such as
whether to support fast charge, battery material types, etc., we use
proportional statistics for analysis.
4.2. Text mining
In the word-of-mouth texts, the details related to the ﬁnal
purchase decision and the uses of EVs are not numerical data but
unstructured textual data. These texts are meaningful, but the
amount of data is too large to be analysed manually. Thus, we use
text mining technology to analyse the text data. In this way, the
details other than the performance parameters with which the
consumers are concerned before the ﬁnal purchase decision and
the consumers ’main purpose to purchase an EV can be explored.
Based on the dependency parsing theory, a language analysis
model using the Bi-LSTM þAttention mechanism was constructed.
The model mainly consists of ﬁve modules: the corpus input
module, corpus pre-processing module, word segmentation mod-
ule, dependency parsing analysis module and entity-relationship
extraction module. The technical process of the language analysis
model is shown in Fig. 2 .
The function of the corpus input module is to input the EV
consumer's comment data collected from the Autohome website.
These comments are usually text data. However, due to the com-
ments' various formats, these data inevitably contain some invalid
information, including emojis, URL links and so on. Therefore, thecorpus pre-processing module is required to perform basic clean-
ing, noise reduction and sentence segmentation for subsequent
data processing and analysis. The function of the word segmenta-
tion module is to segment the original comments and perform
part-of-speech tagging. The dependency parsing analysis module
mainly expresses the segmented sentence in the form of a syntax
tree. In relation classi ﬁcation, the input sentence is segmented by
dependency analysis to construct a dependency-based parse tree,
and the tree structure is then inputted into the Bi-LSTM þAttention
network for relationship information extraction. The main purpose
of extraction is to transform unstructured or semi-structured
Fig. 2. The technical ﬂow of the language analysis model.S.-C. Ma et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 248descriptions of natural language text into structured data. Rela-
tionship extraction is an important sub-task. It is mainly respon-
sible for identifying entities from texts and extracting the semantic
relationship between entities. The speci ﬁc bottom-up process
implemented by the Bi-LSTM þAttention deep neural network is
shown in Fig. 3 , and the core Python program code of this process is
presented in Appendix A . Finally, the relationship vector is applied
to the relation extraction task in the output layer to obtain key
information.
According to the language analysis model presented in Fig. 2 , the
core meaning of the sentence, which appears to be a combination ofa noun and an adjective, are extracted from unstructured textual
data. Before presenting the ﬁnal results, necessary manual checking
should be applied to ensure that the results are concise and easy to
read. For example, many synonyms are merged to avoid a large
number of words with similar semantics appearing in the ﬁnal
results.

substituted into Eqs. (1)e(3), and the consumer's attention to 18
performance indicators is shown in Fig. 4 .
As shown in Fig. 4 , the manufacturer's suggested retail price and
vehicle classi ﬁcation are two factors that consumers are most
concerned about. Consumers' attention to prices far exceeds other
factors, which is in line with our expectations. Indicators 3 to 8 are
all related to EV technology. It can be seen that consumers pay more
attention to the slow charge
3time than the fast charge4time. This
may be because fast charging can only be done at charging stationsthat support fast charging and the number of public charging sta-
tions is not enough, while slow charging only needs a residential
power. As of June 2018, the number of public charging piles avail-
able for China's 1.99 million EVs was only 270,000. The speed with
which charging piles are constructed cannot keep up with the
speed of EV promotion. This uneven ratio actually has a negative
effect on the promotion of EVs ( EVCIPA , 2018 ). Charging time,
including slow and fast charge, is more important than an all-
electric range to consumers. It shows that how long it takes to
refuel (charging) the EV is more important than how far the EV canrun.
Compared with an all-electric range, consumers are more con-
cerned about battery type. This is because the battery type has a
fundamental effect on the battery's performance, such as the spe-
ciﬁc capacity of the battery and its charge and discharge power.
Consumers are more concerned about all-electric range than bat-
tery capacity, which is rational, because the former parameter is the
comprehensive embodiment of a battery's capacity and a vehicle's
energy ef ﬁciency.
From the bottom 9 of the 18 indicators, it can be seen that all two
motor-related indicators, total motor power and motor type, and
ﬁve vehicle size indicators, namely height, length, weight, width
and wheelbase, are included. This shows that consumers' attention
to these two types of indicators, especially the motor performance
indicators, is less than that to the all-electric range and battery-
related performance indicators. Finally, consumers are not so con-
cerned about brand nationality dthat is, Chinese consumers are
not particularly concerned about whether they are Chinese, joint
venture or imported brands when choosing EVs. This is possibly
because EVs made in China account for the majority of sales in
China's domestic market.
5.2. Consumers ’preferences
Substituting a consumer's submission inquiries and an EV's
performance parameters into Eq. (4), the consumer's preference
value based on the purchase inquiry data, P
f, for each performance
index, f, in the three types of EVs can be obtained, as shown in
Table 3 . The performance statistics of consumers' preferences for
the BEVs, PHEVs, and EREVs are detailed in Appendix B .
From the comparison of the data results of the three types of
EVs, it can be seen that the consumers have the lowest preference
price for BEVs donly 241.381 thousand yuan. Of course, this is
directly related to manufacturing costs. The cost of a BEV with an

3Slow charge, refers to charging an EV with 220 V residential or 380 V com-
mercial AC power (the charging power is 1.5 e7 kW) in China, and it usually takes
6 h or longer to completely recharge an EV.
4Fast charge, means charging an EV with high-voltage DC power (the charging
power is usually higher than 20 kW). This is a much faster charging method than
slow charge.S.-C. Ma et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 249all-electric drive system is much lower than that of a PHEV and
EREV with two power systems. Similarly, the BEV without the in-
ternal combustion engine is also the lightest EV, but its all-electric
electric range and battery capacity are undoubtedly the highest of
the three EVs. From the indicators of length, width and wheelbase,
it can be seen that Chinese consumers prefer small-size BEVs
compared to PHEV and EREV sizes. PHEVs have the highest price,
maximum size (length, width and wheelbase), maximum engine
displacement and power among the three EVs, while their all-
electric range and battery capacity are minimal. Consumers' pref-
erence for EREVs is between that for BEVs and PHEVs in terms of
price, all-electric range, battery capacity and size (length, width and
wheelbase). The EREVs' three parameters of motor power, weightand fuel consumption are the highest. It is worth noting that due to
the addition of electric drive systems, PHEVs and EREVs ’combined
fuel economy is much lower than that of the counterpart ICEV. So,
PHEVs and EREVs are suitable as transitional vehicles from ICEVs to
BEVs ( Massiani, 2015 ).
For the performance indicators of the textual data, the statistical
results of consumers ’preferences for BEVs, PHEVs and EREVs are
analysed in the following sections.
5.2.1. Consumers ’preferences for BEV performance
As shown in Fig. 5 , consumers prefer a sedan if they choose a
BEV. Among the BEV purchase inquiries submitted by consumers,sedans accounted for 83.86%, including mini, subcompact, compact,Table 3

sedans accounted for 62.25%. The SUV (sports utility vehicle) and
the MPV (multi-purpose vehicle), which are relatively heavy and
have a poor fuel economy, account for only 13.50% and 2.65%,
respectively. Among the 13.50% of SUVs, the relatively small
models, such as the mid-size SUV and compact SUV, accounted for
11.04%. This shows that, facing BEVs that can only rely on battery
power, consumers prefer to choose small, low-energy-
consumption cars. This is likely due to range anxiety.
Chinese consumers are inclined to choose domestic brands of
BEV, which account for 94.72% of the BEV purchase inquiries. For
battery type, more than half of the EVs selected by consumers have
Lithium terpolymer batteries, including Li(NiCoMn)O 2and Li(Ni-
CoAl)O 2batteries. For the type of drive motor, the concentration is
more obvious. The permanent magnet synchronous motor with
relatively high power-density and torque density is the mainstream
motor. Eighty-four percent of the BEV purchase inquiries submitted
by consumers are equipped with this type of motor. Asynchronous
motors, which are relatively bulky and heavy, account for only 16%.
Among the BEV purchase inquiries submitted by consumers, up to
83.74% support fast charging, and more than 55% of the BEVs' fastcharging time is shorter than 1 h. This shows that consumers value
the ability to refuel (charging) quickly. However, due to the large
battery capacity, 94.56% of the BEVs ’slow charging time is more
than 6 h.
5.2.2. Consumers preferences for PHEV performance
Compared to BEV, PHEV models are much larger. As shown in
Fig. 6 , there are no mini sedans and subcompact cars. SUVs,
including mini SUVs, compact SUVs, mid-size SUVs and full-size
SUVs accounted for 48.48% of consumers' PHEV purchase inquirydfar exceeding 13.50% in BEV purchase inquiries. Moreover, there
are some large models in PHEV that do not appear in BEV purchase
inquiries, such as full-size SUVs and sports cars. This shows that the
PHEV with a gas engine backup has largely eliminated the con-
sumers ’range anxiety about EVs. So, the consumers are willing to
buy a larger and more powerful EV.
For the PHEV brand nationality, the sum of the proportion of
imported and joint venture brands increased from 5.28% in BEVs to
20.28%. The type of motor also becomes a single type of synchro-
nous motor. The ratio of battery material is not much different from
BEV, and the proportion of LiFePO
4battery is slightly increased. For
the charging method, most of the PHEVs that consumers want to
purchase do not support the fast charging function. Even in the
7.51% that supports fast charging, the fast charging time is mostly
more than 2 h. Necessity and price are two main reasons for the
difference of fast charge speci ﬁcations between BEVs and PHEVs.
First, PHEVs have an internal combustion engine as a backup, so
they don't need to be recharged as urgently as BEVs do when their
batteries run out. The second reason is the high price. As shown in
Table 3 , the manufacturer's suggested retail prices of PHEVs are
much higher than BEVs and petrol cars in the same classi ﬁcation. So
manufacturers will not be willing to add fast charging modules to
PHEVs, which will further increase the prices have a negative
impact on sales. However, due to the small battery capacity, the
ratio of the less than 6-h slow charging time in the PHEVs selected
by consumers reached 89.28%.
5.2.3. Consumers preferences for EREV performance
There are few EREV models dthere are only small and medium-
sized sedans and no SUV models. The proportion of compact cars to
Fig. 6. Consumers' preferences for PHEV performance.S.-C. Ma et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 251subcompact cars adds up to a total of 65.87%, as shown in Fig. 7 .
Joint venture brands and imported brands account for 65.87% of all
purchase inquiries, and Chinese brands account for only about one-
third. The EREVs that consumers want to buy all support fast
charging, but 78.76% of the models has a fast charging time of more
than 2 h.
5.3. Other details of consumers ’decision-making concern
In addition to the performance speci ﬁcations and price prefer-
ences of consumers in the selection process, as analysed in Sections
4.1 and 4.2 , the word-of-mouth texts shared by consumers after
purchasing an EV can yield more information beyond EV speci ﬁ-
cations and price. By processing the 1046 comments related to the
details of the ﬁnal decision collected from the EV's word-of-mouth
text, we obtained the factors with which consumers are concerned
in the ﬁnal decision stage, as shown in the word cloud of Fig. 8 . The
green font represents the product-related factor, the red font rep-
resents the brand factor, the grey font represents the service factor
and the golden font represents factors other than the manufac-
turer's suggested retail price that affect the purchase price. The size
of the font is proportional to the number of times the factor is
mentioned.
Appearance and interior are the most signi ﬁcant factors that
consumers consider in their ﬁnal decisions. Appearance, as a very
intuitive factor, appears reasonable and unexpected in the ﬁnal
decision-making factors of consumers. Sometimes, we focus too
much on an EV's technological advancement, product performance
and government incentives, which may make us neglect a very
simple consumer demand dthey want a good-looking car. In fact,
the possibility of innovation in the structure and appearance design
of an EV is precisely the advantage that an ICEV cannot match.
Because of the changes in the power system, the EV no longer uses
the mechanical structure of the ICEV's conventional fuel tank-internal, combustion engine etransmission drive shaft, and the
relatively simple battery-motor-wheel structure greatly changes
the EV chassis structure. Therefore, the functional layout and
design of the EV can be more innovative.
As can be seen from the font size, consumers' consideration of
brand nationality exceeds brand reputation and brand ranking. As
can be seen from the font colour, there are more product-related
factors, indicated by the green font, than the service factors, indi-
cated by the grey font, which shows that the factors related to the
product itself still dominate in the ﬁnal decision-making stage. In
Fig. 7. Consumers' preferences for EREV performance.
Fig. 8. Consumers' concern when making decisions.S.-C. Ma et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 252addition, although the price-related factors have been basically
determined before the ﬁnal purchase decision, there are still
several price factors, such as preferential promotions and price
hikes. However, it is worth noting that the subsidy and tax
exemption policies appear in the word cloud, which indicates that
the government's relevant ﬁnancial subsidies affect consumers'
consumption decisions.
5.4. Uses of EVs by consumers
Through text mining of the word-of-mouth texts published by
consumers, a total of 27,930 comments related to the purpose of
buying a car was obtained. After ﬁnishing the summary, we obtain
the ten categories of EV uses, as shown in Fig. 9 . The blue, red and
green bars represent statistical results from the BEV, PHEV and
EREV owners ’word of mouth. It can be seen for over 30% of the EV
owners, commuting is their main purchase target. Among the uses
of BEVs, PHEVs, and EREVs, all the proportions of commuting,
shopping, picking up children and self-driving tours exceed 10%.
The ratio of the remaining six categories, including business, run
long-distance, dating and communications, freight transport, rac-
ing and off-road, are all less than 10%.
The sum proportion of BEV owners who use a BEV to commute,
shop and pick up children reached 77.4%, and the proportions of allthree uses exceed that of PHEV and EREV users. The sum of run
long-distance, freight transport, racing and off-road account for 6%.
It shows that BEV owners are more focused than PHEV and EREV
owners on short-distance regular travel, which is inseparable from
range anxiety.
PHEV owners purchase cars for self-driving tours, and the
PHEV's run long-distance ratio is signi ﬁcantly higher than that of
the other two EV types. The purpose of the self-driving tour is even
more than 20%, which is related to the presence of additional
gasoline engines as backups and more SUV models.
EREV owners account for a signi ﬁcantly higher proportion of
business travel and dating and communication than the other two
EV types, which is related to the comfort of the sedan models and
the higher price.
6. Conclusions
It is a good idea to manufacture and promote the diffusion of EVs
in accordance with the needs and preferences of consumers. Con-
sumers' demand and preferences for EVs, as an emerging product,
have not yet fully shaped, and many studies have tried to identify
these preferences. This paper analysed consumers' EV preferences
by collecting and recording online consumer behaviour in China,
which has the largest number of EVs in the world. EV sales datawhich was used to study revealed preferences was not adopted in
this paper, because the Chinese vehicle purchase restriction policy
made the EV sales data cannot fully re ﬂect the market demand.
Instead, we used consumers' comparisons of EVs and online pur-
chase inquiry data. In addition, consumers' word-of-mouth com-
ments on EVs were also used as data source, rather than
questionnaires and behavioural experiments which are usually
used for studying stated preferences. Text mining technology was
used in this paper to explore EV owners ’concerns in the ﬁnal
purchase stage and the uses of the EVs. Our analysis yielded several
conclusions that can act as meaningful references for governments
to make policy and EV manufacturers to design products.
The price of an EV is always an important factor for consumers
throughout the entire car purchase process dfrom the initial se-
lection of EV models to the ﬁnal decision before purchase. Espe-
cially in the initial EV models selection and comparison, consumers
pay far more attention to the price than all performance speci ﬁ-
cations of the vehicle.
For consumers, charging time is more important than all-
electric range and battery capacity. That is to say, range anxiety
comes mainly from the inconvenience caused by long chargingtime and insuf ﬁcient charging facilities, rather than short driving
range and small battery capacity. This is reasonable, as it is com-
parable to how ICEV owners do not worry too much about their fuel
tank size because they only need a few minutes to ﬁll up on gas and
there are gas stations everywhere. This ﬁnding shows that for EV
manufacturers, in order to reduce the consumers' range anxiety, it
is more meaningful to shorten the charging time by improving thebattery charging rate than to blindly increase the battery capacity
and extend the driving range.
For EV manufacturers, it is a more rational choice to promote
and produce compact and small BEVs before humans made further
breakthroughs in battery technology and charging approach.
Currently, consumers ’demand for BEVs is concentrated on
commuting and daily short-distance travel. BEVs with fast charging
batteries and short charging time are more popular with con-
sumers than other models which cannot be charging quickly.
Because PHEVs and EREVs have two sets of power systems, a
battery system and a gas engine, consumers are willing to accept
higher prices and a larger size than BEVs. And the purposes of
buying these EVs are more diverse than BEVs. From the perspective
of carbon emission reduction, PHEVs and EREVs have lower fuel
consumption than conventional fuel vehicles of the same class.
Therefore, in order to achieve the emission reduction target, PHEVs
and EREVs are good transitional models for the government's long-
term plan to switch from ICEV to BEV.
Besides the purchase prices and performance parameters, con-
sumers paid more attention on aesthetics, including appearance
and interior, than EV brands, services and other factors. So
upgrading the exterior and interior of an EV is very attractive to
consumers. In addition to subsidizing the purchase price EVs and
the strengthening of EV technological research, improving the vi-
sual design may be another feasible way we ignored in the previous
EV promotion. For EV manufacturers, designing a nice EV is easier
to achieve in the short term than breakthroughs in battery and
motor technology.
There are some limitations in using consumer online behav-
ioural data to study consumers' preferences for EVs. Using con-
sumers' online behaviour data as a data source may neglect some
important factors. For example, because of consumer privacy is-
sues, we are unable to obtain demographic information, such as the
gender, age and income of EV owners. Therefore, it is impossible to
consider consumers heterogeneity in the analysis. In addition, we
cannot collect the consumers ’ofﬂine behaviour. For example, there
may be some cases in which consumers have never inquired aboutFig. 9. Consumers' uses of EVs.S.-C. Ma et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 253any EV information online and went directly to the of ﬂine dealer to
purchase an EV. These cases were not included in our research
sample.
