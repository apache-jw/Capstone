Energy loadsABSTRACT
Mass adoption of the plug-in electric vehicle (EV) technology is imperative for the rapid electri ﬁcation of the
transportation sector to mitigate catastrophic eﬀ ects from climate change. Rapid integration of a large number of
EVs will inevitably cause uncertainty and variability on the operation of the existing electric power system.
There is high uncertainty on not only the speed and scale of EV adoption but also the EV energy and powerrequirements that depends on EV charging patterns. This study uses energy meter-level data from the San Diegoregion to analyze the energy load pro ﬁles of residential customers under the time-of-use (TOU) rate with and
without EV charging requirements. Unlike previous forecasts on the eﬀ ects of EV charging loads, the energy load
proﬁle of TOU customers with EVs reveal a “twin demand peak ”where there is a peak demand during the
evening hours and another at midnight. Results reveal potential issues for grid operations with greater EV
adoption and the importance of careful TOU rate design.
1. Introduction
Major studies have demonstrated the urgent need for a rapid elec-
triﬁcation of the transportation sector to mitigate catastrophic e ﬀects
from climate change ( DOE, 2010; MIT, 2010 ;Slezak, 2013). Large re-
ductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation
sector requires a mix of technology solutions including a rapid elec-
triﬁcation of the passenger vehicle sector to reach emissions reduction
targets ( NRC, 2013 ). Governments around the world have taken direct
action to promote the adoption of the plug-in electric vehicle1(EV)
using new legislation, tax incentives, and other policy instruments.California's Governor Brown has initiated the zero-emission vehicle
(ZEV) mandate that targets the deployment of 1.5 million ZEVs by 2025
(CARB, 2018). Rapid integration of such a large number of EVs will
inevitably cause uncertainty and variability on the operation of the
existing electric power system. There is high uncertainty on not only the
speed and scale of EV adoption but also the EV energy and power re-
quirements. Furthermore, there is an additional unknown human factor
in the anticipated mass adoption of EVs that clouds the forecasted
charging load requirements: when will EV drivers actually charge their
vehicles? These uncertainties have contributed to a condition where
there is no clear roadmap on building the appropriate EV charging in-
frastructure that must be strategically constructed to foster a rapid,
seamless transition to transportation electri ﬁcation.1.1. Literature review on EV charging behavior
Numerous studies have attempted to model and estimate EV char-
ging loads under various scenarios. These studies must make certainassumptions on the daily EV charging patterns that are often di ﬃcult to
validate. Many studies formulate charging scenarios without any actualEV charging data; rather, the scenarios are built based on factors such
as travel patterns. A number of studies use survey travel data to create
charging scenarios. Sioshani and Denholm (2009) considered the
“wherever, whenever ”charging case where charging occurs whenever
vehicles are parked based on travel survey data of the St. Louis me-
tropolitan area. Wang et al. (2017) forecasted the EV charging demand
using synthetic U.S. travel data and electricity pricing. Kang and Recker
(2009) used the 2000– 2001 California Statewide Household Travel
Survey to consider four di ﬀerent scenarios including the case where
vehicles charge whenever they are parked as well as controlled o ﬀ
-peak and public charging cases. Axsen et al. (2011) used a sample of
travel survey data of new vehicle buyers in California to consider threediﬀerent charging scenarios and also incorporated the availability of an
electrical outlet within 25 feet as a prerequisite to charging. Kim and
Rahimi (2014) used travel pattern data at the city level to determine
when EVs would be available for charging then assumed di ﬀerent EV
charging scenarios. Weiller (2011) used the National Household Travel
Survey to create uncontrolled and delayed charging scenarios whererestrictions are placed on certain charging times. Kelly et al. (2012)
expanded on Weiller's recharging scenarios by incorporating

Tdemographic in ﬂuences on charging behavior. There are also studies
that assume an ideal scenario where charging primarily occurs during
late night or the “oﬀ-peak ”hours so that the overall energy load be-
comes more leveled ( EPRI, 2007 ;Kintner-Meyer et al., 2007; Stephan
and Sullivan, 2008).
Recently, the California Energy Commission (CEC) released a major
study on anticipating the required EV charging infrastructure to support
the increasing number of EVs on the road (see Fig. 1). One of the key
results from the study is that the expected peak EV charging load isnearly 1 GW at 7:40 p.m. on a weekday for the entire state. The ex-pected peak on weekends is nearly 800 MW at 6:50 p.m. These results
suggest that EV charging would add to the existing regional load and
increase peak demand, exacerbating the existing problems associated
with excess renewable generation and rapid generation ramping.
2The
vast majority of the EV charging is expected to take place at people'shomes (i.e., residential). Therefore, the e ﬀect from residential EV
charging (L1 & L2) is expected to be signi ﬁcant in both the total energy
load and the shape of the load pro ﬁle (see Fig. 1). One key takeaway
from this study is that the forecast of EV charging loads primarilyhinges on the assumption that EV drivers charge their vehicles based on
travel patterns. That is, most EVs begin charging when EV drivers arrive
at home after work during peak hours (approximately 5 –8 p.m.). This
study attempts to shed light on this assumption using actual meter-levelenergy data from EV owners. Strong evidence against such charging
behavior assumption would have signi ﬁcant impact on the validity and
accuracy of the EV charging load forecasts, which would consequentlyhave an impact on energy policy.
1.2. SDGE energy load pro ﬁle
This article focuses on the San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) service
territory that serves an area spanning from San Diego County to parts of
Orange County (see Fig. 2). SDGE is one of the three major investor-
owned utilities (IOU) in California. It supplies power to roughly 1.4million businesses and residential customers in a 4,100 square-mile
service area ( SDGE, 2018a ).
SDGE's load pro ﬁle is primarily composed of 4 sectors: commercial
& industry, residential, agriculture, and others (e.g., street lights). A
summary of the energy consumption by each sector is shown in Table 1.
Although the overall energy consumption is dominated by the
commercial/industry sector, the overall load shape is dis-
proportionately a ﬀected by the residential sector. For example, the
peak demand occurs when the residential load reaches its peak (roughly
between 5 and 8 p.m.) throughout the year (see Fig. 3). Therefore,
changes to the residential load pro ﬁle would have a signi ﬁcant eﬀect on
the overall system peak and load pro ﬁle.1.3. SDGE rate groups
There are roughly 30 di ﬀerent billing rate groups within the re-
sidential customers in the SDGE service territory. Many billing rates are
special rates with very few actual customers. The majority of the re-
sidential customers fall under the “DR”rate group.
3There are nu-
merous time-of-use (TOU) rate groups. Within the TOU group, there arealso speci ﬁc rate groups that are designated explicitly for residential
customers who charge an EV(s) on the premise.
1.3.1. Standard rate plan (DR)
The DR rate group is the default rate plan for residential customers.
It is a tiered-pricing system with increasing rates with increasing usage.
Each customer is given a monthly baseline usage allowance based on
their location (i.e., climate zones). If a customer exceeds the baseline
allowance by a certain threshold, then the rates increase from Tier 1 to
Tier 2. There is a range of allowable usage within Tier 2. Once a cus-
tomer exceeds the Tier 2 range, then the rates increase to the high usage
charge (HUC) level. An example of SDGE's DR Tier ranges is shown in
Fig. 4.
The baseline allowance and the high usage charge threshold vary
depending on the region and time of year. The coastal regions classi ﬁed
as the “coastal ”climate zone have the lowest baseline allowance be-
cause it enjoys milder temperatures (less cooling and heating needs).

California's CARE program for low-income households. See http://www.cpuc.
ca.gov/General.aspx?id=976 for more information.J.D. Kim Energy Policy 129 (2019) 610–618
611Inland regions progressively have higher baselines allowances because
of the higher temperatures (higher cooling and heating needs). The
allowances are higher in the winter months because the overall system
load is signi ﬁcantly lower (see Fig. 3). A summary of the baseline al-
lowance and high usage charge thresholds are shown in Table 2.1.3.2. Time-of-use (TOU) plans
SDGE o ﬀers time-of-use (TOU) pricing plans to its residential cus-
tomers. In a standard TOU plan, each day is broken into on-peak and
oﬀ-peak time zones with energy costing less during the o ﬀ-peak hours.
Similar to the standard DR plan, the TOU plans are also tiered plans soif a customer exceeds the baseline allowance by a certain threshold, the
rates increase.
4An example of the tier pricing structures in TOU plans is
shown in Fig. 5.
TOU rate structure
Within the TOU pricing plans, there are numerous types and var-
iations that are often a result of experimental rates becoming perma-nent, updated, or removed in subsequent years. Much of the di ﬀerence
between these plans are minimal within the time frame of this study sothe TOU plans are grouped into two main types for brevity: TOU and
EVTOU.
TOU –This is the default TOU rate plan. The plan has a “peak” andTable 1

612“oﬀ-peak ”time intervals with di ﬀerent rates.
EVTOU –This type of plan is intended for residential customers with
electric vehicle (EV) charging loads.
Under each TOU plan, there are speci ﬁc hours ( “blocks ”) that cor-
respond to a time-dependent rate. Examples of such time blocks are o ﬀ-
peak, on-peak and semi-peak hours. These time blocks can vary de-
pending on the day of the week (e.g., weekday vs. weekend) and time of
the year (summer vs. winter). A visual mapping of the di ﬀerent time
blocks for each TOU rate plan is shown in Tables 3 and 4. For all plans,
the time blocks corresponds to the study's scope, which is from January
1st, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Based on survey of EV owners, roughly
73% of EV owners were under some type special EV electric rate plan
between the years 2013 and 2015 ( CSE, 2018). It is highly likely that
this percentage is even higher for the study's time span and future years
due to greater awareness and availability of EVTOU plans.
One of key features revealed in the mapping of the TOU time blocks
is the consistent penalty on energy consumption during late afternoon/
evening hours with the “on-peak ”rates (see Tables 3 and 4). There is
also a consistent incentive for higher energy consumption with the“super o ﬀ-peak ”rates typically from midnight to early morning.
2. Methodology and data
Meter-level electricity consumption data for rate payers in the SDGE
service territory was collected for the year 2016 and 2017. The analysis
presented in this article has a scope that is limited to residential load
data, which includes energy consumption in 1-hour intervals.2.1. Regional data coverage
This study includes meter level data of roughly 1.5 million re-
sidential customers across the city of San Diego and two out of four
“climate zones ”. The SDGE service territory is divided into 30 di ﬀerent
specialized regions designated as “Towns ”. Town 1 is the largest region
which captures the city of San Diego. Each Town can span across
multiple climate zones. For example, the city of San Diego is Town 1 but
spans across climate zones 1, 2 and 4.
The number of data points vary depending on each Town and rate
group. This study focuses on three regions –city of San Diego (Town 1),
Coastal Zone and Inland Zone. Both the Coastal and Inland Zones ex-clude customers from Town 1 (i.e., city of San Diego). The Mountain
and Desert Climate Zones are excluded from the study because of po-tential privacy issues due to the small number of customers for the TOU
and EVTOU rate groups. The sample size (i.e., number of unique cus-
tomer accounts) for each region's rate groups for the study is shown in
Table 5 .
3. Results
The following sections summarize the results from analyzing the
meter-level energy consumption data for the residential customers in
the SDGE region. The results are segmented by three main regions,
weekday or weekend and the major rate groups –DR, TOU and EVTOU.
All load pro ﬁles represent the average hourly load for a given rate
group.

6133.1. DR load pro ﬁles
The DR rate group represent the most common customer energy
proﬁle for any given region. The results closely follow SDGE's overall
residential energy load pro ﬁles (see Fig. 3). The results for the DR group
in San Diego is shown in Fig. 6. The results indicate a peak energy
demand in the evening hours similar to the region's overall energy load
proﬁle (see Fig. 3 ). The energy load on weekends tend to be higher
throughout the day regardless of time of year.
The results for the DR group in the Coastal and Inland Zones is
shown in Fig. 7. The two regions on average have higher loads than the
same group in San Diego throughout the year. The Inland Zone has
higher loads relative to the Coastal Zone especially during the summer
months (Q3). This result is expected because the Inland Zone has higher
summer temperatures leading to greater cooling needs. The overall
shape of the loads for all regions seem consistent for any given time ofyear. There is a single main peak demand occurrence in the evening
between 5 and 8 p.m.
3.2. TOU load proﬁ les
The average energy load for customers in the TOU rate group is
shown in Figs. 8 and 9 for San Diego and the two climate zones, re-
spectively. Similar to the DR group, the results for the TOU group in-
dicate a peak energy demand in the evening hours. Some key di ﬀer-
ences between the two groups are the overall higher energy load levelsfor the TOU group and signi ﬁcantly higher energy loads for the regions
outside of San Diego. Compared to the DR group, each region's TOUrate customers consume signi ﬁcantly more energy throughout the day
regardless of time of the year. Despite the higher electric rates duringpeak evening hours, customers under the TOU plans still consume more
electricity during the peak hours versus non-TOU plan customers. TOU
rate customers in both the Coastal and Inland climate zones consume
signiﬁcantly more energy relative to the comparable group in San
Diego. Some factors that may explain this result may be di ﬀerences in
the square footage of homes, income and climate.
3.3. EVTOU load proﬁ les
The average energy load for customers in the EVTOU rate group is
shown in Figs. 10 and 11 for San Diego and the two climate zones,
respectively. Customers in this group on average have the highest en-
ergy load most likely attributable to the EV charging load requirements.
Similar to the results in other rate groups, customers outside of San
Diego (i.e., Coastal and Inland Zones) have signi ﬁcantly higher energy
loads. More importantly, however, all three regions exhibit energy loadTable 4

614proﬁles that have “twin peaks ”where two energy peaks arise. The ﬁrst
peak energy demand occurs as expected during evening hours (between
5 and 8 p.m.). A second peak energy demand occurs at midnight re-
gardless of region. This second peak at midnight can be directly at-
tributed to the rate structure. Under the EVTOU plans, there is a superoﬀ-peak period that begins at midnight. Since the electric rates are
lowest during the super o ﬀ-peak period, there is a rapid ramping of
energy demand at midnight across all regions for this rate group.
4. Conclusion and policy implications
Results from this study have major implications in energy policy and
grid operations. Using actual energy meter data, this study captured
and analyzed the real-world EV charging behavior in the SDGE service
territory. The analysis reveals three main factors:4.1. EV owners respond to rate plan structure
There was consistent pattern in the energy pro ﬁles of customers
under EVTOU plans –EV owners begin charging their vehicles at
midnight. In all three major regions –City of San Diego, Coastal Climate
Zone and Inland Climate Zone –there was major ramp in energy load at
midnight regardless of the time of year and day of the week. The main
reason for this consistent behavior can be attributed to the incentives
set by the TOU rate structure. The most economical electric rate during
the “super o ﬀ-peak ”period starts at midnight in all of the EVTOU plans.
There is a rapid ramping to a peak load at midnight that decreasesquickly in subsequent hours. This ﬁnding suggests contradictory evi-
dence to the CEC's forecasted residential EV charging loads (see Fig. 1).
One of the key factors that may be attributed to the ﬁnding is the fact
that most EV owners can use smartphone applications ( “apps ”) to easily

615control when the charging to commence. Therefore, EV owners are
simply taking advantage of the super o ﬀ-peak rates by setting the
charging time using smartphone apps.
4.2. EV charging creates new peaks
The load pro ﬁle of the EVTOU groups provides a good proxy mea-
sure of the potential EV charging loads because it represents the actual
energy usage of residences with EV charging loads. Survey results of EV
owners between years 2013 and 2015 showed that roughly 73% of EV
owners were under some type special EV electric rate plan ( CSE, 2018 ).
It is highly likely that this percentage is even higher in future years dueto greater awareness and availability of EVTOU plans. In all regions, EVcharging loads creates “twin peak loads ”in the load pro ﬁle. The ﬁrst
peak coincides with the DR/DRLI rate group's peak load, which isapproximately between 6 and 8 p.m. This peak demand is also con-sistent with the region's overall load pro ﬁle (see Fig. 3). The second
peak demand occurs at midnight when the super o ﬀ-peak period begins
for the EVTOU group. Therefore, the second peak demand is directly
attributed to EV charging and the structure of the TOU rate plan. The
results suggest that residential EV charging loads will create new peak
demand rather than simply exacerbate the existing peak demand during
evening hours (approximately 6– 8 p.m.).
4.3. Rate structure has major impacts
Results reveal the importance of TOU rate structure design. In the
standard TOU load pro ﬁles, there is a single peak load during evening
hours across all regions similar to the region's non-TOU load pro ﬁle
(e.g., DR/DRLI). In the EVTOU load pro ﬁles, however, there are twin

616peak loads with one of the peaks occurring at midnight when the super
oﬀ-peak period begins. The load also decreases rapidly from midnight
to a leveled minimum load within a couple of hours. The explicit choiceof midnight as the time when the super o ﬀ-peak period begins has a
direct impact on the occurrence of the second peak demand. Since mostEV chargers are controlled easily using a smartphone app, it is highly
plausible that EV owners would simply shift the charging activity to the
changes in the TOU rate structure. For example, if SDGE were to change
its super o ﬀ-peak period start time from midnight to 2 a.m., then the
demand peak would simply shift as well to 2 a.m. Therefore, carefulconsideration of the TOU rate design is critical to shaping the load
proﬁle as more EVs are adopted and charged at homes. Poor TOU rate
structure design would lead to unintended consequences such as newpeak demand and rapid ramping requirements.
4.3.1. Limitations
This study's scope is limited to residential EV charging in a parti-
cular region (i.e., SDGE service territory) so the results may not ne-
cessarily be applicable to all other geographical regions. The EV tech-
nology also is still in its early adoption stages so the behavior captured
in the analysis may be only re ﬂective of early adopters and not ne-
cessarily represent the majority/late-adopters of the technology. Thecurrent EV population may be prone to self-selection bias in the TOU
plans chosen so there is uncertainty in the generalization of the results
to a future, larger EV driver population. Furthermore, the charging
loads are strongly correlated to driving intensity and patterns so the
results may not be applicable to a region with signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent
driving patterns.
4.3.2. Future research work
Results from this study clearly show the importance of TOU ratestructure design with respect to EV charging loads. Poor design of the
rate structure can lead to the rise of new energy peaks and other un-
intended consequences. The necessary next research step is the mod-
eling and simulation of the EV charging loads as a function of di ﬀerent
TOU rate structure design and technology adoption rate. For example,the SDGE service territory is expected to experience a signi ﬁcant
growth of EVs over the next decade. As more EV drivers are on the road,there will be greater energy demand at the residential sector. An ana-
lysis on the potential energy load pro ﬁles based on di ﬀerent TOU rate
structures across regions and EV charging load requirements would giveinsights on how to best design the rate structure to induce the best
charging behavior for better grid operations.
