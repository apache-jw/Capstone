Using big data and text mining technologies to explore large quantities of Chinese consumers ’ online behaviour pertaining to EV selection, comparison, purchase inquiry, and comments, we found thatEV prices, car classi ﬁcation and powertrain types were the most important factors in ﬂuencing consumer response. In addition to general interests, we also noted application speci ﬁc interests.For instance, we observed a preference for small battery electric vehicle (BEV) models with fast-charging batteries, which are well-suited to work commutes and daily life.By contrast, when examining plug-in hybrid electricvehicles (PHEVs), we noticed that consumers expressed a preference for sport utility vehicle (SUV) models.Finally, we found that in addition to price and technical speci ﬁcations, EV aesthetics play a signiﬁcant role in consumer choice.

These conclusions are valuable for government agencies and EV manufacturers looking to promote EVs and address environmental pollution by appealing to consume interests. ©2019 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.1.Introduction Compared to internal combustion engine vehicles (IECVs), electric vehicles (EVs)1can reduce CO 2emissions, produce zero tailpipe emissions and emit little noise ( Peng et al., 2016 ).Pro- moting EVs will help achieve the carbon reduction targets of the Paris Agreement while effectively reducing urban air and noise pollution ( IEA, 2017 ).Several countries are vigorously promoting the production and adoption of EVs.As the world's largest con- sumer market for EVs, China's results in promoting EVs areparticularly outstanding.By the end of June 2018, China's EV ownership ranked ﬁrst in the world dreaching 1.99 million units (MOPS, 2018 ).

How to make consumers pay attention to, accept, purchase and use EVs is an important topic for governments and EVmanufacturers alike. To address this topic, it is necessary to study consumer preferences for EVs, which includes identifying the various factors that in ﬂuence consumers ’choices of EVs.With this information, the government can formulate corresponding public policies to promote EV promotion, and manufactures can deter- mine the direction of their production and investment to promote EV sales.Many of the studies which have researched the factors and preferences affecting consumers ’purchase of EV in recent years explored the issue from two main directions: stated preferencesand revealed preferences.To some extent, these two research methods may not fully re ﬂect the true perspective of consumers because of the data sources they used.

Due to the short time of EV promotion, most research is based on questionnaires or experiments to identify consumers' responses and/or behaviours. The conclusions are based on subjective state- ments of intention, which are collected from a questionnaire in an assumed situation or experiment designed by the researcher(s).These subjective statements of intention indicate the consumer's preferences ( Bishop, 1990 ;Cummings and Taylor, 1999 ), and the process of determining preferences by examining subjective*Corresponding author.E-mail address: yfan1123@buaa.edu.cn (Y.Fan).1In this study, EVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and extended range electric vehicles (EREVs).Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Cleaner Production journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/l ocate/jclepro https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.374 0959-6526/ ©2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike the logic of stated preference, the core of revealed preference theory is to infer preferences from consumers' behaviour.In 1948, revealed prefer- ence was proposed by Paul Samuelson (1948) , who believed that the real purchase behaviour of consumers under certain price constraints shows their true inherent consumption propensity, and the investigator can infer the consumer's preference through the customer's actual purchase behaviour.Colombo et al.(2008) argue that this consumer preference, inferred by observing consumer purchase behaviour, is more representative than consumer pref- erences determined by hypothetical scenarios.Although it seems that revealed preferences can approximate consumers' true preferences, there are two problems in studying Chinese consumers' revealed preferences for EVs.

The ﬁrst is the insufﬁcient empirical sales data, which results from a short devel- opment time. Another point is that China restricts vehicle pur- chases, thus preventing the sales data of EVs from fully re ﬂecting consumers ’needs.The majority of EV sales in China are carried out in large and medium-sized cities, while the governments in these cities often issue different forms of vehicle purchase restriction policies to control urban road congestion and air pollution ( Ma et al., 2017 ).Although these restriction policies provide a certain degree of privilege to the sale of EVs, they still suppress the sales of EVs.For example, Beijing granted vehicle registration via a lottery system to limit the increase in motor vehicles.Although the Beijing government has exempted the license lottery regulations for EVs and implemented the method of obtaining license plates as long as consumers apply, the total number of license plates that can be issued is still limited.

In, 2017, a total of 150,000 new license plates were issued in Beijing, including 90,000 ICEV licenses and 60,000 EV licenses ( MOT, 2017 ). However, at the end of 2017, 2,922,537 people in Beijing applied for ICEV license plates, and 123,980 people applied for EV license plates ( BTMB , 2017 ).That is to say, because of the vehicle purchase restriction policy, market transaction data cannot truly re ﬂect consumer demand.Therefore, in this study, we did not use traditional stated or revealed data, but adopted a novel data source ebig data, which is consumers' online behaviour data on a car website.Consumers' online behaviours, such as EV selection, comparison, submission of purchase inquiry and post-purchase comment sharing on the car website, which consumers made without being disturbed by any researcher, were collected for an analysis of consumers ’preferences for EV performance indicators and details as well as EV uses.

Big data maps human behaviour on the Internet ( Herzenstein et al., 2011 ), which is an important reason big data has become a research hotspot in the ﬁeld of information technology in recent years. By analysing the behaviour of EV consumers in a big data environment, the whole process of consumers' decision-making can be observed from the perspective of consumers.Big data overcomes the limitation of traditional stated preference research (Büschken and Allenby, 2016 ), which often uses questionnaires and other experiment methods, in terms of time and space attributes.In the case of insuf ﬁcient sales data, big data provide an opportunity to research consumers' revealed preferences.Combined with text mining technology, we can extract potentially useful information that users are interested in from massive user reviews and discoversome information that manual analysis may ignore ( Zarrinkalam et al., 2018 ).

Moreover, because the full sample is collected directly from the network, the selected bias can be avoided. Therefore, this paper uses big data of consumer online behaviour combined with text mining technology to explore the preferences of EV consumers from the consumer's perspective, under the premise of ensuring the objectivity and comprehensiveness of sample selection.The paper is structured as follows.Section 2presents thedecision-making factors determined in previous studies that affect consumers ’purchase of EVs, and reviews the development of text mining technology.Section 3describes the consumer online behaviour data we collected from the car website.Section 4de- scribes the calculation methods and data processing procedures used in this article.Section 5details the results and the corre- sponding discussion.Section 6concludes the article.2.Literature review2.1.

Consumers ’preferences for EVs Most existing studies have found that external, environmental factors affect consumers' purchases of EV. These factors include the construction of charging stations ( Yu et al., 2016 ;Skippon et al., 2016 ;Hardman et al., 2018 ), charging costs ( Zhang et al, 2018a ), fuel prices ( Gnann et al., 2015 ;He et al., 2017 ), EV purchase sub- sidies ( Lin and Wu, 2018 ), government incentive policies ( Zhang et al, 2018b ), personal carbon trading ( Li et al., 2018 ), and family car status ( Jensen and Mabit, 2017 ).There are also many studies that consider consumers ’own demographic, situational and psy- chological factors ( Li et al., 2017 ), such as lifestyles and habits (Axsen et al., 2015 ), consumer acceptance of new products ( Morton et al., 2016 ), environmental awareness, psychological needs ( Zhang et al., 2013 ), perception and personality ( He et al., 2018 ).

These studies analyse diverse factors from different perspectives that affect consumers' purchase of EVs, but only a small amount of research is aimed at the speci ﬁcations and uses of EVs. In other words, few studies consider the role of EVs ’own factors, such as price and other speci ﬁcations that affect consumer choice.We reviewed some studies which have targeted the impact of speci ﬁc attributes of EVs on consumer choice, as shown in Table 1 .Studying consumers' preferences for EVs' own speci ﬁcations is useful for governments to make policy and manufacturers to design products ( Li et al., 2019 ).Almost all of the studies listed in Table 1 are conducted by means of questionnaires and are explored from a relatively single technical speci ﬁcation perspective.The studies did not fully consider the consumers' preferences regarding the EVs' speci ﬁcations, and the relationship between these speci ﬁca- tions and the consumers' use of EVs were not explored in detail.

In this paper, consumers ’preferences for and uses of EVs are the focus of our study(see Table 2 ). 2.2.Big data and text mining Because consumers of EVs undergo a long decision-making process, there is a lot of data that is dif ﬁcult to analyse.To accu- rately obtain user preferences from massive network data, sup- porting information processing technology is required.The use of big data and text mining technology can avoid the defects caused by the traditional manual extraction method ( Kim and Kang, 2018 ).For example, with the traditional manual extraction method, the selection of samples is affected by subjective factors, and the sample size is smaller due to workload limitation.The main purpose of this paper is to determine consumers' preferences for and uses of EVs from an analysis of consumers ’EV reviews online, so we extract information from the comment ob- jects.

Information extraction refers to using natural language pro- cessing (NLP) and analysis techniques to extract entities, relationships, time and other related content from massive text data ( Sharma et al., 2010 ). Extracting the relationship between the comment object and the comment word is the basis for mining the deep value of the data, because a single comment may involve multiple comment objects of different meanings, and a more ac- curate analysis can be performed only after the comment object isS.-C.Ma et al./ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 245determined.Relationship extraction has always been a research hotspot in the ﬁeld of NLP and is now widely used in various pro- fessional ﬁelds, such as the medical and automotive industries ( Hu and Liu, 2004 ).Such industries often have a large number of pro- fessional terms, and there are different types of relationships be- tween these terms.

The study of information extraction has evolved from a dictionary-based and rule-based approach ( Saif et al., 2012 ), as well as a statistical machine learning-based approach ( Lu et al., 2011 ), to a deep learning-based approach in recent years. The methods based on statistical machine learning mainly include maximum entropy (ME) ( Sriboonchitta et al., 2015 ) and conditional random ﬁelds (CRF) ( Lafferty et al., 2001 ).These methods of semantic analysis are based on semantic dictionaries, and they focus on the construction of emotional dictionaries and the extraction of emotional words.These analysis are also called emotional analysis on the semantic level.This kind of method mainly extracts the semantic features of the comment object by means of the upper and lower positions and synonymous relations in the wordnet.However, in this paper, we prefer to focus on the semantic features related to the comment object.

That is, we consider the close relationship between the comment object and its domain information, and make full use of the unique perspective of each domain datum to extract the comment objects at the phrase level. In recent years, deep learning tools, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) ( Zeng et al., 2015 ), recurrent neural net- works (RNN) ( Jason Alan Fries, 2016 ) and long short-term memory (LSTM) ( Miwa and Bansal, 2016 ), have been extensively applied in NLP.Deep learning is characterized by powerful sequence model- ling capabilities, the ability to accurately capture contextualinformation and the ability of neural networks to ﬁt nonlinearities, which are advantages over CRF.Among them, the LSTM based on dependency parsing (DP) ( Buchholz and Marsi, 2006 ) has the advantage of being able to obtain the relationship between samples over a long time period.

Moreover, the bidirectional-LSTM (Bi- LSTM) ( Tourille et al., 2017 ) developed on the basis of LSTM can more effectively acquire the features before and after the input sentence. For example, in the word segmentation task, compared with the traditional word segmentation algorithm, Bi-LSTM can take advantage of two-way access to sentence features, and the word segmentation effect effectively approximates the perception of human cognition.However, due to the ﬂawed structure of the original time-step model design, as the input sequence continues to grow, the performance of Bi-LSTM worsens.Moreover, adding the ‘Attention model ’can make the task system more focused on ﬁnding useful information related to the current output in the input data, thus improving the quality of the output ( Zhou et al., 2016 ).

The principle of the Attention model is to preserve the intermediate output of the LSTM pair of input sequences and to train a model to selectively learn these inputs and associate the output sequences with the model output. LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-LSTM with attention module had been tested on a same authoritative corpus, Stanford Natural Language Infer- ence (SNLI) ( Bowman et al., 2015 ), for several times.And the per- formance improvement from LSTM to Bi-LSTM, and to Bi-LSTM with attention module are signi ﬁcant.The value of key perfor- mance indicator Accuracy rose from 80.6 in the LSTM to 84.2 in the Bi-LSTM, and rose to 86.8 in the Bi-LSTM with attention module (Chen et al., 2017 ;Liu et al., 2016 ;Parikh et al., 2016 ).In summary, this paper will use the dependency parsing theoryTable 1 Existing literature research on EV speci ﬁcations.

Data Time range Data description Consumers' comparison data of EVsJan. 2017 eDec.2017 The number of consumers' comparisons between two different EVs, a total of 859,622 comparison data.The number of times the consumer compares the kth two different models (e.g.models iand j) is recorded as Ck.Speci ﬁcations of EVs June 2007 eDec.2017 There are a total of 433 models with different styles of EVs (including 316 models of BEV 、110 models of PHEV 、7 models of EREV).Model speci ﬁcations include manufacturer's suggested retail price, brand, all-electric range, motor, battery, body size, weight, and so on.Consumers' purchase inquiries for EVsJan.2017 eFeb.2018 The number of the purchase inquiry for each EV model.The number of consumers who have the intention to purchase EV model iand submit a purchase inquiry is recorded as Qi.Consumers' word of mouth for EVsDec.2012 eDec.2017 Consumers' comments on the EV they bought, which were they voluntarily published at Autohome website.

These comments generally include EV space, power, energy consumption, uses, and why they bought the car. A total of 1046comments were collected.S.-C.Ma et al./ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 246to analyse the grammatical relationship of words in the texts of consumers ’EV comments.In terms of feature extraction and se- lection, the method adopted in this paper is the Bi-LSTM algorithm combined with the Attention model to semantically analyse con- sumer comment text.This method can effectively extract features to represent text and improve recognition accuracy.At the same time, based on the dependency parsing analysis, the word pair with the grammatical relationship is extracted as a feature, and it is possible to avoid using the same vector to represent sentences with the same words but different grammatical structures.3.

Data collection In order to obtain enough consumer behaviour data, we have been working with Autohome,2China's largest auto website, for more over a year since the end of 2016. Behavioural data of con- sumers' browsing, comparing, submitting purchasing inquiry and commenting on the Autohome website were collected to study consumer preferences' for EVs.To facilitate understanding, we simpli ﬁed the process of the consumers' operation on the Auto- home website into three steps, as shown in Fig.1 .Theﬁrst step is the car selection process.Consumers choose several EV models from a large number of models on the website.Among these models, consumers can compare prices and perfor- mance speci ﬁcations.When the consumer ﬁnds the model he/she wants to buy, he/she can start the second step, which is to leave a phone number on the Autohome website and submit a purchase inquiry.

The website will automatically send the contact informa- tion of the consumer to all the dealers who sell the particular EV nearby. The dealer will contact the consumer to inquire about thewillingness to purchase the EV and make an appointment to test the EV of ﬂine.After the consumer completes the EV purchase, he/ she can choose to carry out the third step, which is to share his/her experience with the EV by publishing a comment on the website (this action is also known as ‘word of mouth ’).Consumers' com- ments on EVs are unstructured textual data that contain all infor- mation regarding the EV efrom its selection process to its use.From these comments, we can obtain more subjective evaluation information rather than objective performance parameters.According to the three-step process, we collected the online behaviour data of consumers as follows:If the consumers compare two EV models, then they are inter- ested in both models.

When the consumers do a performance comparison, they are most likely concerned with the differences in performance parameters between the two EVs. Therefore, match- ing the comparison times with the compared EVs ’parameters will yield meaningful results.When a consumer submits a purchase inquiry for an EV on the Autohome website, this indicates that he/she has a strong will- ingness to purchase a particular EV, even though he/she may not be able to purchase the model because of the purchase restriction policy on vehicles.Because car salespeople begin to reach out to whoever submits a purchase inquiry with several phone calls, consumers do not easily leave their contact information.Therefore, the purchase inquiry data can more accurately re ﬂect the con- sumer's willingness to purchase an EV than the sales data, which are suppressed due to the purchase restriction.

Compared with EV comparison data, voluntarily published comment text after the purchase of a car contains more informa- tion. We have selected two information points with research value from the textual data of the comments: the details that affect the ﬁnal decision and the purpose of buying a car.In a large number of commentary texts, we found that many consumers mentioned why consumers chose the EV between two or three models in the ﬁnal stage of the purchase decision.For example, in the choice between the EV iand the EV j, because the steering system of the EV iis better than that of the EV j, the EV iis selected.So the steering system is a detail that consumers value greatly.Moreover, this result cannot be obtained by comparing the speci ﬁcations and price data of EV iand EV j.Thus, this is invaluable information that re- ﬂects the key factors consumers consider in the ﬁnal decision stage before purchasing a car.

Moreover, EV performance parameters, such as driving experience and handling, cannot be expressed innumbers. We collected a total of 1046 comments related to the details of the ﬁnal decision.Another point worth noting is that consumers will provide the main purpose of the EV in comments.These comments often include information, such as ‘the car cannot travel long distances ’,‘the car is mainly useful for commuting in the city ’and ‘the mileage of the car is mostly generated by weekend outings.’We collected a total of 25,070 comments related to why the cars were purchased.4.Methodology4.1.EV performance data processing The study of consumers' EV preferences is divided into two steps.First, it is necessary to identify the performance indicators with which the consumers are most concerned based on the data of consumers' EV comparison and EV speci ﬁcations.

The second step is to analyse the consumers' preference value for these perfor- mance indicators using the consumers ’purchase inquiry data. The speci ﬁc method is as follows.In order to comprehensively examine the consumers' concerns about EVs, 18 indicators are selected from the research results ofprevious scholars listed in Table 1 as potential concerns for con- sumers to choose an EV.In addition to nine concerns about normal vehicles, including the manufacturer's suggested retail price, vehicle classi ﬁcation, brand nationality, number of seats, size (length, width, height, wheelbase) and weight, there are also nine unique characteristics of electric vehicles, including powertrain type, and electri ﬁcation performance (battery type, battery capac- ity, all-electric range, time of slow charging, whether it supports fast charge, time of fast charging, motor type, total motor power).Each of the above 18 speci ﬁcations has been proven by previous scholars as a consumer's focus on EV.

For the average consumer, Fig. 1.The process of consumers buying a car in Autohome.2Autohome ( https://www.autohome.com.cn ) is the most visited professional car website in China.Its DAU (daily active users) reached 35 million.Autohome was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on December 11, 2013, with the stock code, ‘ATHM ’.S.-C.Ma et al./ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 247these indicators include almost all the factors that will affect their purchase choice.So next we can analyse the consumer's attention to each indicator.The consumers ’attention to EV indicator f,Af,i sd e ﬁned as: Af¼X k2KAfk Eq.(1) The following is used when the indicator fis textual data: Afk¼/C26Afk¼0Vfki¼Vfkj Afk¼CfkVfkisVfkjEq.(2) The following is used when the indicator fis numerical data: Afk¼/C26Afk¼0/C12/C12/C12V fki/C0Vfkj/C12/C12/C12<Std f Afk¼Cfk/C12/C12/C12V fki/C0Vfkj/C12/C12/C12/C21Std fEq.

The order of the Afvalues is the order of the consumers' atten- tion to various indicators.For the speci ﬁc indicator f, the preference value is achieved by using the match between the data of the consumers ’purchase inquiries and the EV performance parame- ters.For numerical indicators, such as battery capacity, pure electricrange, etc., we calculate the preference value using the weighted average method.The consumer's preference value for indicator fbased on the purchase inquiry data, P f,i sd e ﬁned as: Pf¼X i2IVfiQi QEq.

(4) where Vﬁis the value of indicator fof the model i,Qiis the number of people who have submitted a purchase inquiry for the EV model i, and Qis the total number of people who have submitted a pur- chase inquiry for the any EV models. This method is to use the data of the consumers' purchase inquiries, instead of the EV sales dataused in the revealed preference research, to directly re ﬂect the consumer's preference and make up for the defect that the EV sales data cannot fully re ﬂect the consumer's willingness to purchase an EV in China.For the performance indicators of textual data, such as whether to support fast charge, battery material types, etc., we use proportional statistics for analysis.4.2.Text mining In the word-of-mouth texts, the details related to the ﬁnal purchase decision and the uses of EVs are not numerical data but unstructured textual data.These texts are meaningful, but the amount of data is too large to be analysed manually.

Thus, we use text mining technology to analyse the text data. In this way, the details other than the performance parameters with which the consumers are concerned before the ﬁnal purchase decision and the consumers ’main purpose to purchase an EV can be explored.Based on the dependency parsing theory, a language analysis model using the Bi-LSTM þAttention mechanism was constructed.The model mainly consists of ﬁve modules: the corpus input module, corpus pre-processing module, word segmentation mod- ule, dependency parsing analysis module and entity-relationship extraction module.The technical process of the language analysis model is shown in Fig.2 .The function of the corpus input module is to input the EV consumer's comment data collected from the Autohome website.These comments are usually text data.However, due to the com- ments' various formats, these data inevitably contain some invalid information, including emojis, URL links and so on.

Therefore, thecorpus pre-processing module is required to perform basic clean- ing, noise reduction and sentence segmentation for subsequent data processing and analysis. The function of the word segmenta- tion module is to segment the original comments and perform part-of-speech tagging.The dependency parsing analysis module mainly expresses the segmented sentence in the form of a syntax tree.In relation classi ﬁcation, the input sentence is segmented by dependency analysis to construct a dependency-based parse tree, and the tree structure is then inputted into the Bi-LSTM þAttention network for relationship information extraction.The main purpose of extraction is to transform unstructured or semi-structured Fig.2.The technical ﬂow of the language analysis model.S.-C.Ma et al./ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 248descriptions of natural language text into structured data.Rela- tionship extraction is an important sub-task.

It is mainly respon- sible for identifying entities from texts and extracting the semantic relationship between entities. The speci ﬁc bottom-up process implemented by the Bi-LSTM þAttention deep neural network is shown in Fig.3 , and the core Python program code of this process is presented in Appendix A .Finally, the relationship vector is applied to the relation extraction task in the output layer to obtain key information.According to the language analysis model presented in Fig.2 , the core meaning of the sentence, which appears to be a combination ofa noun and an adjective, are extracted from unstructured textual data.Before presenting the ﬁnal results, necessary manual checking should be applied to ensure that the results are concise and easy to read.For example, many synonyms are merged to avoid a large number of words with similar semantics appearing in the ﬁnal results.5.Results and discussion 5.1.

EV technical indicators of consumers ’concerns The collected consumer behaviour data from the website are substituted into Eqs. (1)e(3), and the consumer's attention to 18 performance indicators is shown in Fig.4 .As shown in Fig.4 , the manufacturer's suggested retail price and vehicle classi ﬁcation are two factors that consumers are most concerned about.Consumers' attention to prices far exceeds other factors, which is in line with our expectations.Indicators 3 to 8 are all related to EV technology.It can be seen that consumers pay more attention to the slow charge 3time than the fast charge4time.This may be because fast charging can only be done at charging stationsthat support fast charging and the number of public charging sta- tions is not enough, while slow charging only needs a residential power.As of June 2018, the number of public charging piles avail- able for China's 1.99 million EVs was only 270,000.

The speed with which charging piles are constructed cannot keep up with the speed of EV promotion. This uneven ratio actually has a negative effect on the promotion of EVs ( EVCIPA , 2018 ).Charging time, including slow and fast charge, is more important than an all- electric range to consumers.It shows that how long it takes to refuel (charging) the EV is more important than how far the EV canrun.Compared with an all-electric range, consumers are more con- cerned about battery type.This is because the battery type has a fundamental effect on the battery's performance, such as the spe- ciﬁc capacity of the battery and its charge and discharge power.Consumers are more concerned about all-electric range than bat- tery capacity, which is rational, because the former parameter is the comprehensive embodiment of a battery's capacity and a vehicle's energy ef ﬁciency.

From the bottom 9 of the 18 indicators, it can be seen that all two motor-related indicators, total motor power and motor type, and ﬁve vehicle size indicators, namely height, length, weight, width and wheelbase, are included. This shows that consumers' attention to these two types of indicators, especially the motor performance indicators, is less than that to the all-electric range and battery- related performance indicators.Finally, consumers are not so con- cerned about brand nationality dthat is, Chinese consumers are not particularly concerned about whether they are Chinese, joint venture or imported brands when choosing EVs.This is possibly because EVs made in China account for the majority of sales in China's domestic market.5.2.Consumers ’preferences Substituting a consumer's submission inquiries and an EV's performance parameters into Eq.

(4), the consumer's preference value based on the purchase inquiry data, P f, for each performance index, f, in the three types of EVs can be obtained, as shown in Table 3 . The performance statistics of consumers' preferences for the BEVs, PHEVs, and EREVs are detailed in Appendix B .From the comparison of the data results of the three types of EVs, it can be seen that the consumers have the lowest preference price for BEVs donly 241.381 thousand yuan.Of course, this is directly related to manufacturing costs.The cost of a BEV with an Fig.3.Dependency parsing analysis schematic.Fig.4.Consumers' focus on electric vehicles.3Slow charge, refers to charging an EV with 220 V residential or 380 V com- mercial AC power (the charging power is 1.5 e7 kW) in China, and it usually takes 6 h or longer to completely recharge an EV.4Fast charge, means charging an EV with high-voltage DC power (the charging power is usually higher than 20 kW).

This is a much faster charging method than slow charge.S.-C. Ma et al./ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 249all-electric drive system is much lower than that of a PHEV and EREV with two power systems.Similarly, the BEV without the in- ternal combustion engine is also the lightest EV, but its all-electric electric range and battery capacity are undoubtedly the highest of the three EVs.From the indicators of length, width and wheelbase, it can be seen that Chinese consumers prefer small-size BEVs compared to PHEV and EREV sizes.PHEVs have the highest price, maximum size (length, width and wheelbase), maximum engine displacement and power among the three EVs, while their all- electric range and battery capacity are minimal.Consumers' pref- erence for EREVs is between that for BEVs and PHEVs in terms of price, all-electric range, battery capacity and size (length, width and wheelbase).The EREVs' three parameters of motor power, weightand fuel consumption are the highest.

It is worth noting that due to the addition of electric drive systems, PHEVs and EREVs ’combined fuel economy is much lower than that of the counterpart ICEV. So, PHEVs and EREVs are suitable as transitional vehicles from ICEVs to BEVs ( Massiani, 2015 ).For the performance indicators of the textual data, the statistical results of consumers ’preferences for BEVs, PHEVs and EREVs are analysed in the following sections.5.2.1.Consumers ’preferences for BEV performance As shown in Fig.5 , consumers prefer a sedan if they choose a BEV.Among the BEV purchase inquiries submitted by consumers,sedans accounted for 83.86%, including mini, subcompact, compact,Table 3 Consumer's preference for EV.

/ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 250mid-size and full-size sedans, of which mini sedan and compact sedans accounted for 62.25%. The SUV (sports utility vehicle) and the MPV (multi-purpose vehicle), which are relatively heavy and have a poor fuel economy, account for only 13.50% and 2.65%, respectively.Among the 13.50% of SUVs, the relatively small models, such as the mid-size SUV and compact SUV, accounted for 11.04%.This shows that, facing BEVs that can only rely on battery power, consumers prefer to choose small, low-energy- consumption cars.This is likely due to range anxiety.Chinese consumers are inclined to choose domestic brands of BEV, which account for 94.72% of the BEV purchase inquiries.For battery type, more than half of the EVs selected by consumers have Lithium terpolymer batteries, including Li(NiCoMn)O 2and Li(Ni- CoAl)O 2batteries.For the type of drive motor, the concentration is more obvious.

The permanent magnet synchronous motor with relatively high power-density and torque density is the mainstream motor. Eighty-four percent of the BEV purchase inquiries submitted by consumers are equipped with this type of motor.Asynchronous motors, which are relatively bulky and heavy, account for only 16%.Among the BEV purchase inquiries submitted by consumers, up to 83.74% support fast charging, and more than 55% of the BEVs' fastcharging time is shorter than 1 h.This shows that consumers value the ability to refuel (charging) quickly.However, due to the large battery capacity, 94.56% of the BEVs ’slow charging time is more than 6 h.5.2.2.Consumers preferences for PHEV performance Compared to BEV, PHEV models are much larger.As shown in Fig.6 , there are no mini sedans and subcompact cars.SUVs, including mini SUVs, compact SUVs, mid-size SUVs and full-size SUVs accounted for 48.48% of consumers' PHEV purchase inquirydfar exceeding 13.50% in BEV purchase inquiries.

Moreover, there are some large models in PHEV that do not appear in BEV purchase inquiries, such as full-size SUVs and sports cars. This shows that the PHEV with a gas engine backup has largely eliminated the con- sumers ’range anxiety about EVs.So, the consumers are willing to buy a larger and more powerful EV.For the PHEV brand nationality, the sum of the proportion of imported and joint venture brands increased from 5.28% in BEVs to 20.28%.The type of motor also becomes a single type of synchro- nous motor.The ratio of battery material is not much different from BEV, and the proportion of LiFePO 4battery is slightly increased.For the charging method, most of the PHEVs that consumers want to purchase do not support the fast charging function.Even in the 7.51% that supports fast charging, the fast charging time is mostly more than 2 h.Necessity and price are two main reasons for the difference of fast charge speci ﬁcations between BEVs and PHEVs.

First, PHEVs have an internal combustion engine as a backup, so they don't need to be recharged as urgently as BEVs do when their batteries run out. The second reason is the high price.As shown in Table 3 , the manufacturer's suggested retail prices of PHEVs are much higher than BEVs and petrol cars in the same classi ﬁcation.So manufacturers will not be willing to add fast charging modules to PHEVs, which will further increase the prices have a negative impact on sales.However, due to the small battery capacity, the ratio of the less than 6-h slow charging time in the PHEVs selected by consumers reached 89.28%.5.2.3.Consumers preferences for EREV performance There are few EREV models dthere are only small and medium- sized sedans and no SUV models.The proportion of compact cars to Fig.6.Consumers' preferences for PHEV performance.S.-C.Ma et al./ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 251subcompact cars adds up to a total of 65.87%, as shown in Fig.7 .

Joint venture brands and imported brands account for 65.87% of all purchase inquiries, and Chinese brands account for only about one- third. The EREVs that consumers want to buy all support fast charging, but 78.76% of the models has a fast charging time of more than 2 h.5.3.Other details of consumers ’decision-making concern In addition to the performance speci ﬁcations and price prefer- ences of consumers in the selection process, as analysed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 , the word-of-mouth texts shared by consumers after purchasing an EV can yield more information beyond EV speci ﬁ- cations and price.By processing the 1046 comments related to the details of the ﬁnal decision collected from the EV's word-of-mouth text, we obtained the factors with which consumers are concerned in the ﬁnal decision stage, as shown in the word cloud of Fig.8 .

The green font represents the product-related factor, the red font rep- resents the brand factor, the grey font represents the service factor and the golden font represents factors other than the manufac- turer's suggested retail price that affect the purchase price. The size of the font is proportional to the number of times the factor is mentioned.Appearance and interior are the most signi ﬁcant factors that consumers consider in their ﬁnal decisions.Appearance, as a very intuitive factor, appears reasonable and unexpected in the ﬁnal decision-making factors of consumers.Sometimes, we focus too much on an EV's technological advancement, product performance and government incentives, which may make us neglect a very simple consumer demand dthey want a good-looking car.In fact, the possibility of innovation in the structure and appearance design of an EV is precisely the advantage that an ICEV cannot match.

Because of the changes in the power system, the EV no longer uses the mechanical structure of the ICEV's conventional fuel tank-internal, combustion engine etransmission drive shaft, and the relatively simple battery-motor-wheel structure greatly changes the EV chassis structure. Therefore, the functional layout and design of the EV can be more innovative.As can be seen from the font size, consumers' consideration of brand nationality exceeds brand reputation and brand ranking.As can be seen from the font colour, there are more product-related factors, indicated by the green font, than the service factors, indi- cated by the grey font, which shows that the factors related to the product itself still dominate in the ﬁnal decision-making stage.In Fig.7.Consumers' preferences for EREV performance.Fig.8.Consumers' concern when making decisions.S.-C.Ma et al.

/ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 252addition, although the price-related factors have been basically determined before the ﬁnal purchase decision, there are still several price factors, such as preferential promotions and price hikes. However, it is worth noting that the subsidy and tax exemption policies appear in the word cloud, which indicates that the government's relevant ﬁnancial subsidies affect consumers' consumption decisions.5.4.Uses of EVs by consumers Through text mining of the word-of-mouth texts published by consumers, a total of 27,930 comments related to the purpose of buying a car was obtained.After ﬁnishing the summary, we obtain the ten categories of EV uses, as shown in Fig.9 .The blue, red and green bars represent statistical results from the BEV, PHEV and EREV owners ’word of mouth.It can be seen for over 30% of the EV owners, commuting is their main purchase target.

Among the uses of BEVs, PHEVs, and EREVs, all the proportions of commuting, shopping, picking up children and self-driving tours exceed 10%. The ratio of the remaining six categories, including business, run long-distance, dating and communications, freight transport, rac- ing and off-road, are all less than 10%.The sum proportion of BEV owners who use a BEV to commute, shop and pick up children reached 77.4%, and the proportions of allthree uses exceed that of PHEV and EREV users.The sum of run long-distance, freight transport, racing and off-road account for 6%.It shows that BEV owners are more focused than PHEV and EREV owners on short-distance regular travel, which is inseparable from range anxiety.PHEV owners purchase cars for self-driving tours, and the PHEV's run long-distance ratio is signi ﬁcantly higher than that of the other two EV types.

The purpose of the self-driving tour is even more than 20%, which is related to the presence of additional gasoline engines as backups and more SUV models. EREV owners account for a signi ﬁcantly higher proportion of business travel and dating and communication than the other two EV types, which is related to the comfort of the sedan models and the higher price.6.Conclusions It is a good idea to manufacture and promote the diffusion of EVs in accordance with the needs and preferences of consumers.Con- sumers' demand and preferences for EVs, as an emerging product, have not yet fully shaped, and many studies have tried to identify these preferences.This paper analysed consumers' EV preferences by collecting and recording online consumer behaviour in China, which has the largest number of EVs in the world.

EV sales datawhich was used to study revealed preferences was not adopted in this paper, because the Chinese vehicle purchase restriction policy made the EV sales data cannot fully re ﬂect the market demand. Instead, we used consumers' comparisons of EVs and online pur- chase inquiry data.In addition, consumers' word-of-mouth com- ments on EVs were also used as data source, rather than questionnaires and behavioural experiments which are usually used for studying stated preferences.Text mining technology was used in this paper to explore EV owners ’concerns in the ﬁnal purchase stage and the uses of the EVs.Our analysis yielded several conclusions that can act as meaningful references for governments to make policy and EV manufacturers to design products.The price of an EV is always an important factor for consumers throughout the entire car purchase process dfrom the initial se- lection of EV models to the ﬁnal decision before purchase.

Espe- cially in the initial EV models selection and comparison, consumers pay far more attention to the price than all performance speci ﬁ- cations of the vehicle. For consumers, charging time is more important than all- electric range and battery capacity.That is to say, range anxiety comes mainly from the inconvenience caused by long chargingtime and insuf ﬁcient charging facilities, rather than short driving range and small battery capacity.This is reasonable, as it is com- parable to how ICEV owners do not worry too much about their fuel tank size because they only need a few minutes to ﬁll up on gas and there are gas stations everywhere.This ﬁnding shows that for EV manufacturers, in order to reduce the consumers' range anxiety, it is more meaningful to shorten the charging time by improving thebattery charging rate than to blindly increase the battery capacity and extend the driving range.

For EV manufacturers, it is a more rational choice to promote and produce compact and small BEVs before humans made further breakthroughs in battery technology and charging approach. Currently, consumers ’demand for BEVs is concentrated on commuting and daily short-distance travel.BEVs with fast charging batteries and short charging time are more popular with con- sumers than other models which cannot be charging quickly.Because PHEVs and EREVs have two sets of power systems, a battery system and a gas engine, consumers are willing to accept higher prices and a larger size than BEVs.And the purposes of buying these EVs are more diverse than BEVs.From the perspective of carbon emission reduction, PHEVs and EREVs have lower fuel consumption than conventional fuel vehicles of the same class.Therefore, in order to achieve the emission reduction target, PHEVs and EREVs are good transitional models for the government's long- term plan to switch from ICEV to BEV.

Besides the purchase prices and performance parameters, con- sumers paid more attention on aesthetics, including appearance and interior, than EV brands, services and other factors. So upgrading the exterior and interior of an EV is very attractive to consumers.In addition to subsidizing the purchase price EVs and the strengthening of EV technological research, improving the vi- sual design may be another feasible way we ignored in the previous EV promotion.For EV manufacturers, designing a nice EV is easier to achieve in the short term than breakthroughs in battery and motor technology.There are some limitations in using consumer online behav- ioural data to study consumers' preferences for EVs.Using con- sumers' online behaviour data as a data source may neglect some important factors.For example, because of consumer privacy is- sues, we are unable to obtain demographic information, such as the gender, age and income of EV owners.

Therefore, it is impossible to consider consumers heterogeneity in the analysis. In addition, we cannot collect the consumers ’ofﬂine behaviour.For example, there may be some cases in which consumers have never inquired aboutFig.9.Consumers' uses of EVs.S.-C.Ma et al./ Journal of Cleaner Production 229 (2019) 244 e255 253any EV information online and went directly to the of ﬂine dealer to purchase an EV.These cases were not included in our research sample.Acknowledgement This study is funded by R &D project of National Grid of China under No.5202011600UA.Support from the National Natural Sci- ence Foundation of China under Grant No.71690245 is also acknowledged.Appendix A Python program code of Bi-LSTM þAttention model and training.Appendix B Table B1 Consumer's preference for BEV BEV factors weighted average max min median Std.Dev.

This study focuses on consumers ’ sentient attitudes toward charging infrastructure and the effect of consumer attitudes toward the construction of charging piles and NEV sales using natural language processing technology and the panel vector autoregressive method. Consumers ’ sentient attitudes (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) were inferred by analyzing consumer comments on charging infrastructure obtained from the internet.The key reasons for consumers ’ negative attitudes were further investigated, and the diversity in their attitudes was explored at the city level.The results show a growing concern for consumers about charging infrastructure since 2013.The overall satisfaction of consumers has constantly improved.The top pain points that cause consumers ’ negative attitudes are inconvenient charging, charging dilemmas, inability to install private charging piles, etc.

Consumers ’ negative attitudes have a signif - icantly positive impact on the charging piles ’ construction. It also has a significantly negative impact on the sales of NEVs, but the effects are themselves short-term.Usually, the impact of negative attitudes is stronger than that of positive attitudes.1.Introduction A new energy vehicle (NEV) ’s low driving range provided by its battery is one obstacle to its diffusion (Gnann et al., 2018 ; Globisch et al., 2019 ).Research that stimulates the diffusion of the electric vehicle market often focuses on charging infrastructure, which is widely perceived as contributing to the popularization of electric vehicles (Skippon and Garwood, 2011 ; Axsen and Kurani, 2013 ; Plotz and Funke, 2017 ; Palomino and Parvania, 2019 ; Globisch et al., 2019 ; Patt et al.al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020 ).

Consumers ’ attitudes are a direct indicator of the evaluation of charging infrastructure construction (Stoutenborough and Vedlitz, 2014 ; Jiang et al., 2016 ). Consumers are direct users of charging infrastructure, and their sentient attitudes are an important basis for optimizing and developing charging infrastructure.However, few scholars have researched consumers ’ attitudes toward charging infra- structure.Instead, they focused on charging-load analysis (Fu et al., 2020 ; Yang et al., 2020a ; Luo et al., 2020 ; Tao et al., 2020 ), charging station layout planning (Zhang et al., 2019a , 2019b ), the economic benefits of charging stations (Yang et al., 2020b ), and consumers ’ preferences for charging infrastructure (Patt et al., 2019 ; Fang et al., 2020 ; Illmann and Kluge, 2020 ).There is little literature on consumers ’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure, but more on consumers ’ attitudes toward electric and fuel cell vehicles.

Survey questionnaires (Egbue and Long, 2012 ; Lebeau et al., 2013 ; Larson et al., 2014 ; Junquera et al., 2016 ; Wu et al., 2020 ) or interviews with users (Hardman et al., 2016 ) to obtain their attitudes have mainly been used. However, an open social platform could restore the thoughts and opinions of consumers, freeing the transmission of information from time and geographical restrictions (Yin and Wu, 2019 ).Therefore, this study innovatively uses natural language pro- cessing (NLP) technology to investigate consumers ’ opinions posted on social media and analyzes their attitudes toward charging infrastructure.This study analyzes consumers ’ sentient attitudes toward charging infrastructure and explores regional differences in consumers ’ attitudes and the interactions between consumer attitudes, charging infrastruc - ture construction, and NEV sales based on consumers ’ social media comments about charging infrastructure.First, consumers ’ attitudes *Corresponding author.

The novelty of this study is as follows: First, rather than using traditional questionnaire data, internet data on consumers’ comments about charging infrastructure were collected and utilized. Consumers’ sentient attitudes (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) were measured by analyzing consumers’ comments on charging infrastructure using NLP technology, which is a method that is more responsive to general problems than one determined by hypothetical scenarios.Therefore, this study provides a novel approach to modeling consumers’ attitudes to- ward charging infrastructure by using digital technology to study the barriers to the adoption of NEVs.Second, the diversity of consumers’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure at different city levels was explored further, and it provides a reference for policy-makers to formulate NEV development policies tailored to local conditions.

Third, the impact of consumers’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure con- struction and NEV sales was further evaluated, providing insights for the development of NEVs. The rest of this study is structured as follows: the methodology and data are introduced in Section 2.The results and findings are given in Section 3.This is followed by a conclusion and policy implications in Section 4.2.Methodology and data 2.1.Data collection and filtering Five social media platforms2 about automobiles that Chinese con- sumers most commonly used were selected to collect consumers’ com- ments about charging infrastructure using the Python programming language.Keywords such as “charging pile”, “charging station” and “battery swap” were searched.Finally, 63,693 comment data points were crawled and collected.Each piece of data includes the user ID or username registered on the website, date, province, city, data source, and comment (see the Appendix, Table A.1).

The period of the sample data is from August 2013 to June 2020. The comprehensive and accurate analysis depends on the comments being highly relevant to charging infrastructure.A keyword-matching method was first used to filter out the comments containing “charging” or “battery swap”.Then, a manual filter method was used to exclude comments posted by nonindividual consumers, such as adver - tisements and news.Finally, 13,254 comments were obtained.A controversial question is whether the comments from consumers on public social media are biased because of the existence for aggressive comments due to the anonymity of social platforms.This study assumes that a small number of extreme comments cannot affect the results based on the following reasons.First, the number of extreme comments is relatively too small to affect the results, and second, the emotional po- larities of positive and negative sentiments in consumer comments do not change even if there are aggressive comments.

However, when NLP technology is used to analyze consumer sentiment, there are still methods that can further improve the robustness and sensitivity of the analysis. For example, when dictionaries are used to quantify the posi- tive and negative emotions of consumer comments, the impact of con- sumers’ excessive emotional catharsis on the results can be reduced by reducing the weight of some extreme words.And for research that at- tempts to obtain more detailed emotional categories of the public, ma- chine learning method can be used to classify the public’s emotions into more emotional categories (e.g., hope, happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, etc.) (Cao et al., 2021; Kabir and Madria, 2021), or analyze public sentiment from different dimensions of magnitude and polarity (Corbett and Bastin Tony Roy Savarimuthu, 2022).

Additionally, the data regarding the number of charging infrastruc - ture constructions came from the China Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance (http://www.evcipa.org.cn/). Data in 27 sample provinces and cities from February 2016 to October 2019 were selected because of the lack of data in other provinces, namely, Anhui, Beijing, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, Jilin, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Sichuan, Tianjin, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Chongqing.The sales volume of NEVs mainly included the sales volume of pure electric vehicles (PEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).The data came from Dasouche Zhiyun (https://zhiyun.souche.com).2.2.Analytical methods The sentiment analysis of each comment was performed by using NLP technology.

A sentiment value greater than 0 was a positive atti- tude, a sentiment value less than 0 was a negative attitude, and a sentiment value equal to 0 was a neutral attitude. On this basis, for all negative attitude comments, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) theme modeling approach was used to analyze the key reasons that caused consumers to have negative attitudes toward charging infrastructure.Second, the differences in consumers’ attitudes at different city levels were analyzed.Third, a PVAR model was used to analyze the in- teractions between consumers’ positive and negative attitudes toward charging infrastructure, the number of charging infrastructures, and the sales of NEVs.The research framework is shown in Fig.1.2.2.1.Sentiment analysis Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is the task of extracting and analyzing people’s opinions, sentiments, attitudes, per- ceptions, etc., toward different entities, such as topics, products, and services.

It is a powerful tool for businesses, governments, and re- searchers to extract and analyze public moods and views, gain business insights, and make better decisions (Birjali et al., 2021). The BosonNLP3 sentiment dictionary was used to perform sentiment analysis on each consumer’s comment (Fig.1).First, the BosonNLP sentiment dictionary was loaded.Second, the Jieba word segmentation tool4 was used to segment each comment.Third, the stop vocabulary 2 Autohome inc.(http://ir.autohome.com.cn/), PCauto (bbs.pcauto.com.cn), Xcar (http://www.xcar.com.cn/bbs/), Weibo Corp (https://weibo.com/), and Zhihu (https://www.zhihu.com/).3 BosonNLP sentiment dictionary is an emotional polarity dictionary based on data sources such as Weibo, news, and online forums.It contains many online vocabulary and informal abbreviations, and has a high coverage of nonstandard language expressions.It is suitable for text analysis of online social media (Yin and Wu, 2019).

4 Jieba is a Python Chinese word segmentation component, which provides a dictionary of Chinese character prefixes. For the words in the prefix dictionary, a directed acyclic graph is constructed, and word segmentation can be completed via dynamic programming.For words that do not exist in the prefix dictionary, a hidden Markov model is needed.Developers can also specify a custom dictionary to include words that are not in the Jieba thesaurus, and adding new words by themselves can ensure a higher accuracy rate.For a more detailed introduction, please visit: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba.Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 3list5 of the Harbin Institute of Technology was used to clean up the word segmentation results.Finally, the BosonNLP sentiment dictionary was used to score the sentiment of each comment.

A sentiment value greater than 0 was a positive attitude, a sentiment value less than 0 was a negative attitude, and a sentiment value equal to 0 was a neutral atti- tude. Finally, 8526 positive comments, 4616 negative comments, and 112 neutral comments were obtained.In addition, the release of policies related to charging infrastructure and electric vehicles may also cause fluctuations in consumers ’ senti- ment.Therefore, to analyze whether policy releases have a direct impact on consumers ’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure.First, “new energy vehicles ” and “charging piles ” were used as keywords to search the Chinese government website (http://www.gov.cn ), and all “policy ” type contents were saved.Then, the number of policies in 2013.1- 2020.6 was calculated, and 88 policies were obtained.

Finally, the Pearson correlation coefficient method was used to analyze the corre - lation between the number of positive/negative attitudes and the number of policies, and the results showed that there was no correlation between consumer attitudes and policy releases. Therefore, changes in consumer attitudes are caused by the construction of charging infrastructure.Consumers ’ sentiment index toward charging infrastructure in the t-th month is characterized using the following equation: Sentiment index tln 1pos tE 1neg t (1) where post represents the number of positive attitude comments in month t, and negt represents the number of negative attitude comments in month t.When there are more positive attitude comments, the con- sumer sentiment index is greater than 0; otherwise, it is less than 0.2.2.2.

LDA model Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) technology is a probabilistic generative model originally developed for topic modeling, and its main purpose is to discover latent themes that permeate a corpus. Once an LDA is trained, two outputs are generated: word distribution per topic and topic distribution per document.The latter can be regarded as another document representation in which word frequencies and se- mantic information (topic composition) are considered (Kim et al., 2019 ).Fig.2 shows how each parameter is connected to documents and words (Sarkar et al., 2016 ).Suppose there are M documents, N words in the documents, and K topics you want to generate.In an LDA model, choosing the number of topics K is considered one of the most challenging problems.The optimal number of topics can be derived from perplexity or human judgment (Hagen, 2018 ).Perplexity6 is usually used to measure the quality of a trained language model in NLP.Blei et al.

(2003) used perplexity in an LDA model to determine the optimal number of topics. The lower the perplexity is, the better the performance of the model.For a test set containing M documents, the perplexity is calculated as follows: perlexitye ⋃M d1logp Wd⋃M d1Nd(2) The occurrence probability of each document (p W) is calculated as follows: p W̂ zp z̃N n1p wn†z (3) where in Equations (2) and (3), z is the topic variable and N represents the number of words in the document.In this study, the LDA model was used to classify and analyze the reasons for negative attitude comments.The perplexity was first calcu - lated, and then the number of topics with the lowest perplexity was the value of K.2.2.3.PVAR model The panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model was proposed by Holtz-Eakin et al.(1988) .

It combines the traditional vector autore - gressive (VAR) method (i.e., all variables in the system are treated as endogenous variables, and there is no need to set the causal relationship between variables in advance) with the panel data method, allowing unobserved individual heterogeneity (Love and Zicchion, 2006 ). Compared with the long-term sequence requirements of the traditional VAR model, the PVAR model has the characteristics of a large cross-section and a short time sequence (Zhang et al., 2016 ).Therefore, this study is suitable for using the PVAR model to analyze the in- teractions between consumer attitudes, NEV sales, and the number of Fig.1.Research framework of consumers ’ attitudes.5 Stop words are words automatically filtered out before or after processing natural language data (or text) to save storage space and improve search effi- ciency in information retrieval.Stop words are usually divided into two cate- gories.

One is functional words with no actual meaning, such as “the”, “is”, and “at”. The other is words that are widely used, such as “want ”, which make it difficult to help narrow the search range and reduce search efficiency.6 Perplexity is a canonical figure for describing the modeling capabilities of a language model (Bimbot et al., 2001).It is monotonically decreasing in the likelihood of the test data, and is algebraically equivalent to the inverse of the geometric mean per-word likelihood.A lower perplexity score indicates better generalization performance (Blei et al., 2003 ).Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 4charging piles.

The PVAR model is as follows: yitΓ0̂n p1Γpyit pfidteit (4) where yit is a three-variable vector {lnPO it, lnNEV it, and lnCP it}, lnPO it is the natural logarithm of the number of positive or negative comments in the i th province in month t, lnNEV it is the natural logarithm of the number of NEVs sold in the i th province in month t, and lnCP it is the natural logarithm of the cumulative number of public and private charging piles constructed by the i th province in month t. p represents the lag intervals, fi represents the individual effect of different provinces, dt represents the time effect of different periods, and eit represents a random disturbance term with a normal distribution.See Section 2.1 for the data source.3.Results and discussion 3.1.Evolution characteristics of consumers ’ attitudes The consumer sentiment index for the charging infrastructure is shown in Fig.3.

First, consumers have been increasingly concerned about charging infrastructure since 2013, according to the number of positive and negative comments, which increased by 51% on average every month. Second, the positive comments on charging infrastructure are in the majority.The proportion of months with consumer sentiment index greater than 0 accounted for 95%, and the average consumer sentiment index was 0.56.Third, it shows growing consumer satisfaction with charging infrastructure over time because the fluctuation of the consumer sentiment index, measured with the variance, decreased from 0.29 before 2017 to 0.07 after 2017 with the improvement of charging infrastructure.3.2.Main influencing factors of consumers ’ attitudes NLP technology was used to analyze all negative comments to explore the main factors that caused consumers to have a negative attitude toward charging infrastructure.

First, Jieba word segmentation was performed for all negative comments, and the frequency of each word was counted. Second, perplexity calculation was used to determine the number of topic classifications, and then the LDA model was used to group consumers ’ main concerns about charging infrastructure.Third, the n-gram word segmentation method was used to analyze the main reasons that affect consumers ’ attitudes.Fourth, evolutionary charac - teristics of consumers ’ attention to charging infrastructure were analyzed with half a year as the time interval.3.2.1.Word frequency statistics The 50 most frequently used words among all negative comments are shown in Table 1.

This shows that in addition to the two basic words “charging pile” and “charging ”, consumers ’ main concerns include the installation of private charging piles (e.g., “install, ” “parking space, ” “property, ” “community, ” “electricity meter, ” and “wires ”), battery driving range (e.g., “battery, ” “range, ” “kilometer, ” “motorway ”), and the mode of charging infrastructure to supplement power for electric vehicles (e.g., “home, ” “fast charging, ” “slow charging, ” “battery swap station ”), etc. Additionally, many words can reflect the psychological state of consumers, e.g.“anxiety ” and “want ”.3.2.2.LDA topic classification The LDA model was used to classify the negative comments.First, the perplexity was calculated according to Equations (2) and (3), with the number of topics K [1, 2 …, 50].The calculation results are shown in Fig.4.Perplexity was lowest when K 6.

Therefore, the optimal topic number is six, and the top five keywords with the highest weight are extracted for each topic. According to word frequency statistics, these 30 keywords account for 17.3% of all 18,783 words.Then, the trigram algorithm was used to obtain accurate infor- mation about consumer comments.The trigram algorithm can form a phrase for every three words from the beginning to the end of a sentence, and then it counts the frequency of each phrase, so consumers ’ intent can be fully understood.The top five keywords for each topic and the phrases related to each keyword with the highest frequencies are shown in Table 2.As shown in Table 2, Topic 1 is highly related to the “charging method ”, consumers hope to use private charging piles at home to charge an electric vehicle easily.When a private charging pile cannot be installed, they usually use the high-power socket at home to connect the charging cable to charge the electric vehicle.

Topic 2 is related to the “range of electric vehicles ”, including the mileage of an electric vehicle after being fully charged and charging electric vehicles on motorways to increase the range. Topic 3 is the “installation problem of private charging piles ”.Private charging piles cannot be installed because there are no fixed parking spaces, or the community property management Fig.2.LDA analysis framework.Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 5firm obstructs the installation of private charging piles.Topic 4 is the “performance shortcomings of electric vehicles, ” including the travel distance of electric vehicles, battery life, attenuation of the driving range because of turning on air conditioning, and long charging time.Topic 5 is related to “range anxiety, ” including charging time, driving range anxiety, power loss caused by air conditioning, and whether there are charging piles in motorway service areas.

Topic 6 is related to the “charging dilemma ” because consumers cannot install private charging piles. They need to use high-power sockets at home to charge or find public charging piles outside the community, thus facing the dilemma of inconvenient charging and high charging prices.According to the six topics, the main reasons for consumers ’ negative attitudes toward charging infrastructure are summarized.First, the charging is inconvenient.Second, the driving range of PEVs is limited.Third, private charging piles cannot be installed.Fourth, the charging mode was not satisfactory.Fifth, consumers ’ range anxiety.Sixth, the charging dilemma of charging piles.3.2.3.Evolutionary characteristics of the topics In this section, the evolutionary characteristics of those 6 topics were analyzed to capture the changes in consumers ’ concerns at half-year intervals.First, Jieba word segmentation was performed on the nega- tive comments in each period.

Then, Equation (5) was used to calculate consumers ’ attention degree to each topic in different periods. AD it̂5 j1fijt×wiji1C2C…C6 (5) where ADit is the consumers ’ attention degree to topic i in period t, fijt is the word frequency of the j th keyword in the i th topic in period t, and wij is the weight of the j th keyword in the i th topic obtained in the LDA topic modeling.Fig.5 shows the degree of consumers ’ attention to each topic in different periods.Consumers ’ concerns are highly consistent in different periods.The charging method and charging dilemma are the two top topics with which consumers are most concerned.Therefore, convenient charging infrastructure has always been the largest demand of Fig.3.Evolution trends of consumer attitudes and sentiment index.Table 1 Top 50 most frequently used words.Word Freq.Word Freq.Word Freq.Word Freq.Word Freq.

Ac- cording to a survey of electric vehicles’ travel characteristics, the average daily travel distance of private electric vehicles is 69 km (approximately 43 miles).7 The main scene of consumers’ range anxiety is long-distance travel, according to the analysis in Section 3.2.2. Therefore, the convenience of daily charging is the main problem faced by consumers.3.2.4.Further analysis This section further analyzes different types of charging piles, different charging scenarios, and the improvement measures that con- sumers expect from charging infrastructure.First, for DC fast charging and AC slow charging, all negative com- ments containing the keywords “fast charging” and “slow charging” were screened out respectively.Among them, 4.68% of the negative comments mentioned “fast charging”.5.91% of the negative comments mentioned “slow charging”, indicating that more consumers pay atten - tion to slow charging.

Then, using the trigram segmentation method, the terms associated with “fast charging” and “slow charging” were ob- tained respectively, and the following social network graph was formed Table 2 LDA topic classification and trigram segmentation with frequency.

Y. Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 7(Fig.6).It can be found that worrying about fast charging harms the battery and affecting the service life of the battery, and worrying that fast charging speed will cause some virtual power are the main reasons why consumers have negative emotions about fast charging piles.The slowly charging speed that resulting in longer charging waiting time, and the property does not agree to install private slow charging piles in the community are the main reasons why consumers have negative emotions about slow charging piles.Second, for different charging scenarios, all negative comments containing keywords such as “expressway ”, “home ”, “company ”, and “charging station ” were screened out respectively.

Among them, “home ” was the charging scene with the highest number of comments, ac- counting for 8.56% of the total number of negative comments, followed by “expressway ” accounting for 4.72%, “charging station ” and “company ” accounting for 3.79% and 1.13%, respectively. Then, the trigram segmentation method was used to obtain the terms associated with “expressway ”, “home ”, “company ”, and “charging station ” respectively, and the following social network graph was formed (Fig.7).It can be found that due to the inability to install private charging piles, the air-conditioning socket is used at home to charge the electric vehicle, there are problems such as circuit cutting and the inability to pull the wire due to the high floor is the main reason why consumers have negative emotions about the charging scene “home ”.

The lagging construction scale of charging piles leads to queues when charging on the expressway, causing expressway traffic congestion, and worrying about the lack of charging piles on the expressway are the main reasons why consumers have negative emotions about the charging scene “expressway ”. Fears that there are no charging stations Fig.5.Degree of consumers ’ attention to each topic.Fig.6.DC fast charging and AC slow charging social network.Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 8in the expressway service area, and hope that the number of charging stations will be the same as the number of gas stations are the main reasons why consumers have negative emotions about the charging scene “charging station ”.Therefore, consumers who need long-distance travel pay more attention to the construction of public charging piles.

Concerns about insufficient charging parking spaces, the lack of public charging piles near the company, and the incompatibility of charging pile types are the main reasons why consumers have negative emotions about the charging scene “company ”. In addition, in the social network graph, the thicker the connecting line, the greater the weight of the node.Therefore, Fig.7 shows that, in all charging scenarios, consumers are most concerned about installing private charging piles at home and the charging piles in expressway service areas.Finally, how do consumers hope to improve the charging infra- structure?42 negative comments with the keyword “hope ” were screened out, accounting for 0.95% of all negative comments.Then, the trigram segmentation method was used to obtain the terms associated with “hope ”, and the following social network graph was formed (Fig.8).It can be found that consumers want to improve the charging infrastructure in four areas.

First, it is hoped that the community allows to install the charging piles, and the property can agree and assist in the installation of charging piles. Second, it is hoped that the number of charging piles will increase, including the construction of more charging piles in urban areas and expressway service areas.Third, it is hoped that the driving range of electric vehicles will increase, and the battery attenuation will be less.Fourth, it is hoped that the charging software Fig.7.Social network of charging scenarios.Fig.8.Social network of improvement plan.Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 9can be more intelligent, showing whether the nearby charging parking spaces are parked, and whether there are already cars charging in the charging piles.3.3.

Analysis of regional differences This section analyzes consumers’ different attitudes toward charging infrastructure at different city levels.8 First, the sentiment index of consumers at different city levels was calculated according to Equation (1), as shown in Fig. 9.It is found that consumers at different city levels have different sentiment indices for charging infrastructure.The more developed the cities are, the lower the consumer sentiment index and the higher the proportion of negative sentiments.The less developed the cities are, the higher the consumer sentiment index and the higher the proportion of positive sentiments.The attention degree of consumers at different city levels to each topic is shown in Fig.10.Topic 1 “charging methods” is the most con- cerning topic for all city levels, followed by Topic 6 “charging dilemmas” and Topic 3 “private charging pile installation”.There is generally low attention to driving range and range anxiety.

This indicates that con- sumers are generally more concerned about the convenience of charging. Therefore, improving the convenience of charging will effec- tively overcome the shortcomings of battery performance and help to promote the diffusion of NEVs.For topics 3 and 6 in Fig.10, consumers in first-tier cities, new first- tier cities, and second-tier cities pay more attention than those in fourth- tier cities and fifth-tier cities.This may be due to the more developed economies of second-tier and above cities, facing serious air pollution, traffic congestion, and other problems.Therefore, the government has made greater efforts to promote NEVs, and NEV ownership is higher.However, the cost of land in second-tier and above cities is high, and both the installation of private charging piles and the construction of public charging stations will face more problems.

Although consumers in third-tier, fourth-tier, and fifth-tier cities pay significantly more attention to electric vehicle charging methods than those in second-tier and above cities, their attention to the driving range, private charging pile installation, range anxiety, and charging dilemma are all relatively low. This may be because consumers in third-tier cities and below have a low degree of recognition of NEVs.However, due to slight environ - mental pollution in these cities, consumers are less willing to buy NEVs, and most consumers who buy NEVs to reduce the car using cost can conveniently charge.3.4.Interactions between consumers’ attitudes, charging infrastructure construction, and NEV sales 3.4.1.Panel unit root test and lag interval selection The stationarity of each time series was tested to prevent spurious regression using Stata 14.Table 3 shows the results of the Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC) unit root test.All variables are stationary series at the 95% con- fidence level.

Then, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and Hannanqing information criterion (HQIC) were used to estimate the lag interval (see Appendix, Table A.2). The lag interval was equal to 1 for the PVAR model of negative attitudes, charging pile construction, and NEV sales.The lag interval was equal to 7 for the PVAR model of positive attitudes, charging pile construction, and NEV sales.Because the HQIC provides a consistent estimate of the true lag interval (Lutkepohl, 2005).3.4.2.Impulse response relationship analysis The impulse response function9 was used to analyze the impact on the other two variables when one variable (i.e., consumer attitudes, the number of charging piles, and the sales of NEVs) fluctuates.Thereby revealing the interactions between consumers’ positive attitudes, the number of charging piles, and the sales of NEVs in Fig.11 and the in- teractions between negative attitudes and the other two variables in Fig.12.Fig.

11 shows that the positive fluctuation in a positive attitude has a positive impact on the NEV sales and a higher positive impact on the construction of charging piles. Second, the positive fluctuation in NEV sales positively impacts consumers’ positive attitudes after two periods of negative impact and has a continuously positive impact on the con- struction of charging piles.Finally, the positive fluctuation in the con- struction of charging piles has a significant and continuous positive impact on consumers’ positive attitudes and NEV sales.Fig.12 shows that, first, the positive fluctuation in negative con- sumer attitudes has a long-term negative impact on NEV sales.It also has a positive impact on the construction of charging piles.However, negative attitudes’ cumulative negative impact on NEV sales is signifi - cantly greater than its cumulative positive impact, according to the area enclosed by the impulse response curve and the coordinate axis.

This indicates that solving the main factors that cause consumers’ negative attitudes will be more helpful in promoting the diffusion of NEVs. Sec- ond, the positive fluctuation in NEV sales has a cumulatively positive impact on consumers’ negative attitudes and has a continuously positive impact on the construction of charging infrastructure after one lag period.Finally, the positive fluctuation in the construction of charging infrastructure negatively impacts negative attitudes, and has a contin - uously positive impact on NEV sales.This indicates that the construction of charging infrastructure will promote NEV sales.3.4.3.Variance decomposition Fig.13 shows that for negative consumer attitudes, the average contribution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 0.77%, and the average contribution rate of charging infrastructure construction fluctuations is 2.7%, which means a significantly higher impact.

Second, for the con- struction of charging infrastructure, the average contribution rate of consumer negative attitude fluctuations is 1.66%. The average contri - bution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 4.93%, which means a signifi - cantly higher impact.Finally, for NEV sales, the contribution rate of charging infrastructure construction fluctuations is 10.73%, and the average contribution rate of negative consumer attitude fluctuations is 11.82%, which means a significantly higher impact.Fig.14 shows that for positive consumer attitudes, the average contribution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 0.15%, and the average contribution rate of charging infrastructure construction fluctuations is 6.65%, which means a significantly higher impact.

Second, for the construction of charging infrastructure, the average contribution rate of positive consumer attitude fluctuations is 0.77%, and the average contribution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 1.82%, which means a significantly higher impact. Finally, for NEV sales, the average contri - bution rate of positive attitude fluctuations is 0.26%, and the average contribution rate of fluctuations in charging infrastructure construction is 2.32%, which means a significantly higher impact.8 The city level is based on the “2020 City Business Charm Ranking List” released by the New First-tier Cities Research Institute (https://www.yicai.com/news/100648666.html), which divides cities into first-tier cities, new first-tier cities, second-tier cities, third-tier cities, fourth-tier cities, and fifth-tier cities.

This report assesses China’s 337 prefecture-level and above cities based on the collected commercial store data of 170 mainstream consumer brands, and the user-behavior data and city statistics of 18 leading internet companies in various fields (see Appendix A.3 for details). 9 The impulse response function describes the current response and the trend of subsequent response effects of a variable when faced with the impact of another variable in a system while keeping all other impacts at 0 (Zhang et al., 2016).Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 104.Conclusions and policy implications In this study, consumers ’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure based on consumers ’ comments published on social media from August 2013 to June 2020 were measured and analyzed using NLP technology and the PVAR model by distinguishing consumers ’ positive and negative attitudes and evaluating their effects on electric vehicle sales and charging infrastructure construction.

Big data analysis methods were used to study the barriers to adopting new energy vehicles. The main conclusions are summarized as follows.First, consumers have been increasingly concerned with the charging infrastructure since 2013, and the proportion of months with positive attitudes accounted for 95%.Overall, consumer satisfaction has improved.Second, the top six pain points that cause consumers ’ negative attitudes are inconvenient charging, charging dilemmas, inability to install private charging piles, unsatisfactory charging modes, range anxiety, and the limited driving range of PEVs.Analysis of different charging scenarios showed that 8.56% of the charging scenarios focus on “home ”, impossible to install private charging piles and can only use air- conditioning sockets for charging are the main negative reasons.4.72% of charging scenarios focus on “expressway ”, the lagging construction scale of charging piles in expressway service areas is the main negative reason.

Therefore, the most concerning aspect for Chinese consumers is the convenience of charging infrastructure. Thus, improving the rele- vant policies for the installation of private charging piles can help improve consumer sentiment, for example, policies that encourage the construction of communal charging piles or establishing a charging pile- sharing mechanism to encourage consumers to share private charging piles may ease the charging dilemma.Moreover, clarifying the interest of community properties in installing private charging piles would be beneficial to increasing their support enthusiasm.Then, the construction and layout of public charging piles also need to be strengthened.Third, it shows an interesting diversity of consumers ’ attitudes to- ward charging infrastructure at different city levels.

The more developed the cities are, the higher the proportion of consumers ’ negative attitude; the less developed the cities are, the higher the proportion of consumers ’ positive attitude. The possible reason is that there are more serious problems of inconvenient charging and higher charging costs of NEVs for consumers in developed cities.Therefore, formulating differentiated Fig.9.Sentiment index of consumers at different city levels.Fig.10.Degree of consumers ’ attention to each topic at different city levels.Table 3 Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC) panel unit root test results.Variables t-star P Ft lnNEV -7.5954 0.0000 lnCP -11.0552 0.0000 lnComment_neg -10.1993 0.0000 lnComment_pos -4.5468 0.0000 Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 11 Fig.

Fig.12.Impulse response of negative attitude, NEV sales, and charging pile construction Note: lnComment_neg is the natural logarithm of the negative comment amount.Y.Wang et al.Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983 12charging infrastructure construction policies at different levels of cities will also help improve consumer sentiment, for example, for the first- and second-tier cities, policy priority is given for solving the problem of inconvenient charging and charging costs.In contrast, for the third-tier cities and below, it is more necessary to strengthen the publicity and promotion of NEVs to improve consumers ’ awareness and acceptance of NEVs.

Fourth, impulse response analysis shows that consumers ’ negative attitudes have a significant and continuing negative impact on the sales of NEVs, and the average contribution rate of negative attitude fluctu - ations to the sales of NEVs is 11.82%. Consumers ’ negative attitudes positively impact the construction of charging piles.Still, the effects are short-term and gradually decline toward zero after reaching their peak in the 5th period.Consumers ’ positive attitudes have a positive impact on the sales of NEVs and the construction of charging piles.Still, its effect on the sales of NEVs is much smaller than that of consumers ’ negative attitudes.Therefore, a negative attitude plays a more important role in NEV sales.Thus, optimizing and solving the main factors that cause consumers ’ negative emotions will have a positive effect on pro- moting consumers ’ acceptance of NEVs.Division of work Yuanyuan Wang, writing, data curation, methodology, software.

ARTICLE INFO Keywords: Electric vehicleEV charging load Typical daily profile Demographic Travel mode Monte CarloABSTRACT Travel pattern of an electric vehicle (EV) user and the accuracy of their probability distribution models are the key factors affecting the simulation and prediction of EV charging load.

Introduction Due to urban environmental pollution and the global energy crisis, many governments have set ambitious goals for the development of electric vehicles (EVs) [1], resulting in rapid growth for EVs worldwide [2]. France and UK have announced to stop sales of petrol and dieselautomobilesby 2040.Denmarkhasproposed abanon thesaleofdiesel and petrol vehicles from 2030 and hybrid from 2035.However, many studies have shown that a large number of EVs will require a con- siderableamountofchargingelectricity [3,4]andsignificantlyincreasethe peak load and randomness on the demand side [5], which increase the expenditures on the capacity expansion and operational pressure of the distribution networks [6,7].To alleviate the above issues, it is of importance to simulate and predict the EV charging load reliably.Most existing works established the simulation and prediction model based on various data mining algorithms and primarily threekinds of datasets.

National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) [26-28]and GPS data [29,30], including driving time, duration, distance, and des- tinations. Currently, this method has been becoming the mainstream category because of the reliability and easier availability of such data.Many previous works of this method focused on developing probabil- istic models of vehicle driving patterns and utilized various stochastic algorithms to simulate the driving and charging events at different lo- cations and times, e.g.Monte Carlo [31-34], Markov chain [35], kernel density estimation [36], state-space model [37].The EV charging load canbepredictedifthe forecastofEV travelbehaviour isavailable [26].However, the reliability of this method is restricted by the re- presentativeness and accuracy of the probabilistic distribution models.

Existing research shows that people of different ages, incomes, and educational background have different working and living patterns [38,39],whichleadstodifferenttravelmodeandenergyconsumptions. For instance, an individual’s occupation will significantly affect the departuretimeofthedailytripandtheirparkingtime [3]aswellasthe peak load of the daily load profile [40].Few studies have been refining theimpactsofdemographicsonthetravelpattern,whichbringshidden errors to the charging load simulation.To fill the research gap, this paper presents a simulation method for the daily EV charging load based on the travel pattern and demo- graphics of car user.Probabilistic models of several spatial–temporalvariables are established according to different day type and locations to improve model accuracy.With the consideration of different char- ging preference and power consumption rate, the daily profile of EV charging load is simulated using Monte Carlo method.

In the end, ty- pical EV load profiles for various user groups (e.g. male, female, highly educated and low educated population, etc.) are provided and com- pared.The results show that the user's demographic and social attri- butes have a considerable effect on the magnitude and peak time of the EV charging load profile.The rest of the paper is organized as follow.Section II demonstrates the travel pattern of different populations, which is the foundation of this work.Section III proposes the overall framework of the charging load profile simulation considering user classification.Section IV de- fines the variables of spatial–temporal travel characteristics and pre- sents their refined modelling methods to improve the fitting accuracy.SectionVandVIdevelopsthemodelforsimulatingthetravelbehaviour and EV charging load considering the charging preference and power consumption rate, etc.

Zhang, et al. Applied Energy 274 (2020) 115063 2this section, the travel data for different user groups are analyzed in terms of both time and space dimensions to understand the travel patterns of different populations better.The demographic attributes considered and their classifications are shown in Table 1.The departure time of the first trip, the end time of the daily trip, andthedailytravellingdistanceareselectedtocomparethedailytravel behaviour of different EV user groups.The U.S.NHTS dataset is taken asanexample [41],asshownin Fig.1-Fig.3.Ingeneral,thedailytravel of different groups has their characteristics; thereby, it is necessary to consider the differences between various populations in the modelling of travel pattern.It can be seen from Fig.1the departure time of the first trip for young and middle-aged people is concentrated at around 7:00 am during the workday, which is consistent with the commuting time of students and office workers.

The departure time for the elderly is generally later and more flexible, ranging from 7:00 am to 11:00 am, which is also in line with the lifestyle of retired older adults. A similar rule applies to the end time of daily travel.Young adults tend to arrive home from 16:00 to 18:00, while the arrival time of the elderly is widely distributed from 11:00 am to 18:00.As shown in Fig.(c), the elderly have shorter daily travelling distance, which can be attributed to the physical and psychological condition of the elderly.Fig.2shows that the time for the relatively low-level educated peoplegoingtoandgettingoffworkismoredispersedcomparedtothat for the other people; moreover, more people leave for work at noon or during midnight as well as get off work at very early daytime or during midnight than the higher-educated people.This might be because peoplewithlowereducationlevelsusuallyperformunstablejobs.

Fig.3 shows that the males’ attendance time is generally earlier than that offemales and their daily driving distance is also longer. 3.ChargingloadprofilesimulationconsideringUsers’ demographics As demonstrated above, EV users with different demographic characteristics show distinct travel modes, which affects the profile shape and magnitude of the charging load.To improve the re- presentativeness of the travelling models and therefore the accuracy of the charging load simulation, the charging load model should be es- tablished for various user categories according to their demographics (e.g.gender, education background, age).This section clarifys the overallframeworkofthemethodologytosimulatetheEVchargingload profile for different vehicle user categories.Taking one demographic attribute (gender) as an example, the method of modelling the typical charging load curves for male/female users is described.Fig.4shows the main process as well as the input and output at each stage.

The typical curves of the other user groups can be derived by analogizing the following steps. 1).Filter the travel data according to the demographics of each user, e.g.male/female.2).Taking the filtered data as input, establish the probabilistic models ofalldefinedspatial–temporaltravellingvariables(i.e.startingtime of the first travel, driving time, parking time and driving distance) for male/female users.The modelling method of the probabilistic travelling models was explained in Section IV, and the detailed probabilistic models used for different variables and user categories are shown in Table 2.3).Taking the above probabilistic models as input, use the methods presentedinSectionVandVItosimulatethetravelbehavioraswell astheenergyconsumptionandchargingeventsduringthedailytrip with additional consideration on day type, location type, charging preference and the rate of battery energy consumption.

Then, a given number of samples (charging load curves) are generated for male/female users. Note that the number of generated samples can be changed according to the number of EV users and demographicsin the simulated area.4).Averageandnormalizethecurvesofmale/femaleuserstoeliminate the effects of abnormal loads, the simulation number, and the unit of load on typical curves.The min–max normalization is adopted as shown in (1) =xx x x xtt t t tmin max min (1) where xt is the charging load at the time tafter normalization; xtis the original charging load at time t; xtmin.and xtmax are the minimum and maximum values of the charging load time series, respectively.To fa- cilitate the curve comparison, the minimum and maximum values are taken as the same.Modelling Method of Travel Characteristics 4.Modellingmethodoftravelcharacteristics The user's travel characteristics are an essential input for simulating the EV charging load.

Different driving behaviours have a profound impact on the location and duration of a charging event. For example, an increase in driving time duration will lead to an increase in EV en- ergy consumption and longer charging time; driving to different desti- nations will change the spatial distribution of the charging load.Therefore, accurate modelling of travel features is a crucial part of the entire charging load simulation process.This section proposes a gen- erally adaptive modelling method for the probabilistic models of tra- velling time–space variables, laying a foundation for the subsequent development of EV charging load models for different user groups.

In this paper, the accuracies of the probabilistic distribution models of all travel variables are improved by using various algorithms, in- cludingBurrTypeXII,Lognormal,Stable,Normal,GeneralizedExtreme Value (GEV), Weibull, Exponential, Gamma, Birnbaum-Saunders, Inverse Gaussian, Loglogistic, Logistic, Nakagami, Rician, and t Location-Scale (tLS) distribution. The above algorithms can cover a wide range of distribution shapes and satisfy the diversity of distribu- tion patterns in various defined travel variables.For example, the Normal curve is bell-shaped, low at both tails, high in the middle, and left–right symmetrical.The Logistic distribution has a longer tail and a higher kurtosis than the normal distribution.The Inverse Gaussian, the Lognormal and the Nakagami distribution are used to model right- skewed, non-negative data.

The Stable distribution and the t Location- Scale distribution are suitable for modelling heavy tails (more prone to outliers).TheExponentialdistributionisaparticularcaseofthegamma distribution, and it is useful in modelling events that occur randomly over time. The Burr distribution includes many commonly used dis- tributions such as gamma, lognormal, loglogistic, bell-shaped, and J- shaped beta distributions (but not U-shaped).The selected distribution models are used to fit a given variable respectively, and the model which performs best is determined as the adopted one.The evaluation indexes of the model accuracy are the coefficient of determination R2and the corrected coefficient of de- termination Ra2 as shown in (2–3).== =Ry y y y( ¯) ( ¯)in i in i2 12 12 (2) Table1 Demographic Groups.Demographics Categories Gender Male Female Age 16–44 45–59 ≥60 Education level Bachelor below Bachelor or aboveJ.Zhang, et al.

A.Probability Distribution Fitting of Time Variables In this paper, probability distributions of three temporal variables (starting time of the first trip in a day, the time duration of the car driving and car parking) are fitted to quantify the temporal character- isticsofthedailydrivingtrip.Firstly,thestartingtimeofthefirsttripis fitted.Secondly, the time duration of the car driving is classified ac- cording to the starting place and trip destination; noted that the prob- ability distributions of different categories are fitted respectively.Finally, the time duration of the car parking is classified according to the type of parking place, and the probability distributions of different groups are fitted respectively.

Eight types of driving time are separately fitted using the lognormal distribution with different fitting parameters. 3).Time duration of the car parking - Tp Parking time limits the length of the charging period and charging load, and affects the following destination.For example, if the parking time is short and the charging energy demand is high, the car user willprefer to select the fast charging mode; and, if the parking time and charging time is extended, there probably will be more destination options because of being able to drive to farther destinations.According to the types of parking places and workday/weekend, parking time is divided into six categories.Distribution models of six kinds of parking time are shown in Table 4.B.Conditional Probability Distribution of Driving Distance In this paper, driving distance dis regarded as obeying the prob- ability distribution under the condition of driving time.

According to the same classification way as driving time, driving mileage is also divided into eight categories. Eight types of driving distance in the i-th time window are separately fitted using Normal distribution.The con- ditional probability density function is shown in (5).= P d t e ( | )1 2d i id µ1 2( ) ii 22 (5) where ti isthei-thtimewindowofdrivingtime; µi istheaveragevalue of driving distance in the i-th time window; i is the standard deviation of driving distance in the i-th time window.C.Spatial Transition Probability Spatial transition probability refers to the likelihood that a car is driving from destination Dm to the next destination +Dm1 at a specific timeslot.Assumedthatthecurrentdestination Dm isonlyrelatedtothe last destination Dm1 regardless of other previous destination, the spatial transition probability can be written as (6).

The corresponding probabilistic models for a given population are taken as model inputs including the discrete spatial transition probability matrix and probability distribution of all defined spatial–temporal travelling variables. All the variables are sampled sequentially, thereby the daily driving trip of each user can be obtained.1).The starting time of the first trip is sampled based on the corre- sponding distribution under the condition that the starting place of the first trip is home.2).With the gained starting time, the destination is sampled by the corresponding spatial transition probability under the condition ofthe known starting time and starting place.3).With the gained destination, the driving time is sampled by the corresponding distribution under the condition of the obtained starting place and trip destination.

To improve the load si- mulation accuracy, the charging preference is considered during theload simulation. Two types of charging behaviours are designed.1).A conservative charging preference EV charging would be started when the is met.This means that EV users will charge their cars when the remaining energy in the EV bat- teries is unable to support the energy consumption of the next trip.+ E w d C 0.2 m end n m, 1 (8) where Em end, is the remaining energy (kW·h) in the EV battery when arriving at the m-th trip destination; wn is the energy consumption per kilometer (kW·h/km) of the n-th car; 0.2C (kW·h) is the lower limit of remaining energy in an EV battery.2).A positive charging preference EVs will be charged regardless of whether or not is satisfied.The charging load is calculated by combining the charging as- sumptions with the sampled travel process.Take a specific trip of a vehicle as an example, the simulation process is illustrated below and shown in Fig.5.

1) The energy consumption of this trip is calculated by multiplying theTable2 Probabilistic Models for Different Genders (Workday).

5) The charging time duration of this parking event is calculated by dividing the energy consumption by the charging power and also constrained by the parking time limit. 6) The SOC of the EV battery is updated again when the car leaves the parking place.7) Repeat the step 1 to 6, the charging time duration and charging power of each parking event in a day for one vehicle are calculated.Thetimeseriesofchargingloadofthisvehicleineachparkingplace can be obtained.8) Repeat the step 1 to 7, the daily load profiles of a given number of EVs in different places can be simulated.The regional charging load profile can be calculated by aggregating the profiles for all the ve- hicles..7.Casestudy A.Data discription and model assumption This paper assumes that the travel mode of EV users is the same as that of fuel vehicle users.Data used in the case study come from thetravel data packet in the U.S.NHTS in 2009 [41].

In this data packet, travel information of each trip for each car during a day is recorded,including starting and ending time, driving time, driving distance andparking time. It also includes the demographic information of the re-spondents (e.g.gender, age, education, occupation, income, etc.), which is the basis for distinguishing each type of user.According to the statistics of the data, it is assumed that each car user can make up to three trips a day.In this paper, some parameters are assumed in the simulation, which is not always accurate in reality.The energy consumption rates and capacity of each EV are randomly selected from a specific range according to current battery technology.The charging power and the number of EVs in a region are assumed to be constant.However, these parameters can be modified easily if real-world data are available.The specific values of the parameters in the case are set as follows.1).100,000 EVs are simulated.2).

the energy consumption rate of each EV is randomly set to 0.1 ~ 0.25 kW·h/km, the capacity of each EV battery is randomly chosen from 40 ~ 50 kW·h, and the initial SOC is 0.8C. 3).considering the battery degradation due to over-charging or over- discharging, the upper and lower limits of SOC are set to 0.2 and 0.8, respectively.4).the charging power in the W, O, H1 region is 8 kW, while in H2 region is 4 kW [43].B.Probability Distribution of Time Variables 1).Starting time of the first trip Tofitthestartingtimeof thefirsttrip, threedistributionmodelsare proposed and compared.Table 5.shows the used distribution models Fig.5.Process of simulating the charging load.J.Zhang, et al.Applied Energy 274 (2020) 115063 7and their performances.It is found that the Burr Type XII distribution works the best.

And, the coefficient of determination and the corrected coefficient of determination for the Burr Type XII distribution is higher than that for other distributions by over 10%, for both workday and weekend. The probability distributions of the starting time of the first trip for different day types are showed in Fig.6.For workday, the fitting parameters are: α= 7.986, C = 6.696, K = 0.609.For weekend, the fittingparametersare: α=11.46,C=5.79,K=1.24.Asshowninthe Fig.6, the probability distributions of the starting time of the first trip between workday and weekend are different.Distribution on workday is mainly around 8:00 am, which coincides with the real-world situa- tion.And, the distribution on weekend is mainly concentrated around 10:00 am, which is in line with people's weekend schedule.2).Driving time duration The probability distributions of eight types of driving time are shown in Fig.7andFig.8respectively.

It is observed that the driving time for both workday and weekend obey the lognormal distribution well. The differences in the distributions of different types of driving time for the same day type are obvious.The fitting parameters for workday and weekend are shown in (9) and (10), respectively.= == == == =µ µ µ µ 2.995 0.737 2.816 0.79 3.069 0.749 3.176 0.759I III IIIII IIIIV IV (9) = == == == =µ µ µ µ 2.815 0.783 2.701 0.815 2.883 0.782 3.073 0.765I III IIIII IIIIV IV (10) 3).Parking time Considering different parking places and different day types, the performance of different distribution models for parking time is shown inTable 6.and Table 7.Nearly all the distibutions achieved above 0.9 fitting accuracy.The best fit appears to the distribution of W place andO place on workday, whose coefficient of determination and the cor- rected coefficient of determination are higher than that of the other benchmarks by over 0.35.

Distributions of parking time for different places on workday/weekend are shown in Fig. 9andFig.10respec- tively.Itis suggested thatthedistributionsare well fittedexcept fortheones of the workplace.ForWplaceonworkday,thefittingparametersare α=1.324, β=- 0.51,γ= 66.379, δ= 535.77.For H place on workday, the fitting parameters are α = 3032.83, C= 1.043, K= 27.171.For O place on workday, the fitting parameters are k= 0.765, σ= 35.419, μ= 63.477.For W place on weekend, the fitting parameters are μ= 461.059, σ= 191.418.For H place on weekend, the fitting parameters are a= 169.309,b= 1.133.For O place on weekend, the fitting parameters are α = 53.199, C= 4.619, K= 0.305.C.Spatial Transition Probability Matrix Spatial transition probability matrixes for the two randomly se- lected time periods on workday/weekend are shown in Fig.11.As shown in the figure, the trip destination is closely related to the tra-velling time period.

And, the spatial transition probabilities for workday and weekend are different during morning rush hours but are almost the same during evening rush hours. D.Impacts of Charging Preference on Charging Load In this section, the distributions of charging load at different energy consumption rates (energy consumption per kilometer) for the twotypes of charging preference are shown in Fig.12.To clarify the sen- sitivity of energy consumption rate and charging preference on thecharging load, the charging load needed for the trip driving from H2 to W are demonstrated as an example.Taking the point (10–20, 6) on the curve as an example, it means that for EV users whose commuting duration is 10 to 20 min, their demand for charging in this trip reaches 6 × 10 4kW.As shown in the figure, for the conservative charging preference, energy consumption rate has a significant impact on the charging load distribution.

Meanwhile, for the positive charging preference, the en- ergy consumption rate has very limited impacts on the charging load, and the demand for charging is much higher than the conservative charging. This might be because EVs would becharged once arriving at the destinations, and the driving distance of each trip and the desti- nation type would have larger impacts on the charging load demands than the energy consumption rate.Note that, according to the probability distribution of driving time, driving time is mainly between 10 and 20 min.Therefore, for the second type of charging preference, the charging load of EVs with the driving time of 10–20 min is significantly higher than the rest driving time.However, for the first type of charging preference, the driving time duration with the highest charging load is not 10–20 min but 60–70 min.

More importantly, the charging load for the driving time of 10–20 min is reduced, which is good to the grid, because a car with aTable5 Results of Different Distributions on Workday/Weekend (Starting Time of First Travel).

Based on the above results, this section attempts to provide the daily charging load profiles for different user groups. Fig.13toFig.15are typical charging load profiles for different age groups, gender groups, and educationgroups.Theresults show thatthe typical profiles of different user populations have large differencesunder certain conditions (e.g.workday, office areas), which proves thenecessity of considering population classification in this paper.Fig.13 toFig.15can be found in Appendix.Ascanbeseenfrom Fig.13,theageoftheEVusershasasignificant impact on the shape, peak and peak time of the load profile, especiallyon weekdays and office areas.This is caused by the difference of working and living patterns of various age groups.1).On weekdays and H1 region, the load profile of elderly people shows a single sharp peak, and the peak appears at noon – 12:00.This might because the elderly people have more time staying at home during the daytime.

The load profiles of users of other ages show double peaks at around 10:00–11:00 and 16:00. This might because the young people go home for lunch break and dinner and a) Type 1 b) Typ e 2 c) Type 3 d) Typ e 4Fig.7.Probability distribution of driving time on workday.a) Type 5 b) Typ e 6 c) Type 7 d) Type 8 Fig.8.The probability distribution of driving time on the weekend.Table6 Results of Different Distributions of Parking Time on Workday.Parking Time Distribution Standard R2 Ra2 W Normal distribution 0.5543 0.5451 Generalized extreme value distribution 0.4057 0.3872 Stable distribution 0.9614 0.9598 O lognormal distribution 0.5695 0.5660 Generalized extreme value distribution 0.9243 0.9234Weibull distribution 0.3906 0.3856 H Weibull distribution 0.9477 0.9470 Gamma distribution 0.9496 0.9489 Burr Type XII distribution 0.9596 0.9581Table7Results of Different Distributions of Parking Time on Weekend.

In addition, load profile of older adults have lower peak because they normally re- turn home at flexible times, resulting in random time of charging. 3).In the W region, the higher the age of the users is, the lower the charging demand they require.In particular, the daily total char- ging load of elderly users is extremely lower than that of the younger users by up to 77%.This might because the older users are less active and drive less, which is related to factors concerning physical strength and mentality.Fig.14shows that the shapes of the charging load profile for males and females are similar.However, the charging demand of males ishigher than that of females, and the difference is even larger on the weekend, reaching 46% in the H1 region.Due to physical differences,male users are more tolerance to long-distance driving and more likely to travelling out on the weekends.Fig.

15shows that the difference in education levels are mainly reflected in the load profiles for the commuting regions (i.e. H2 and W region), while the differences in magnitude and shape of the profiles in other regions are very small.In the H2 region, the evening rush hours for the high-educated people are later than the low-educated people, which are 20:00 and 16:00, respectively.In the W area, the charging demand of the highly educated population is significantly higher than that of the low educated population (up to 32%), and has a much clear morning peak.It might be for the reasons that, highly educated people are generally more willing to work hard, and low educated people al- ways have more irregular working hours.8.

Conclusions In this paper, an EV charging load simulation method is proposed based on users’ demographics, refined probabilistic distribution models of temporal-spacial travel mode and other additional factors, including charging preference and energy consumption rate. Different from tra- ditional methods, the proposed method utilizes refined probabilistic modelswith consideration of daytypeand location aswell as the users’ demographics to improve the simulation accuracy.Based on the im- proved method, the typical daily profiles for various user groups are provided.Theresultsinthecasestudyvalidatetheproposedmodeland compare the load profiles of various categories of EV users.•The demographics of EV users have a significant effect on the magnitudeand peaktimeofthe dailycharging load, particularlyfor workdays and workplace.•The accuracy of the probability distribution models of various spa- tial–temporal variables is improved by considering additional re- fined conditions.

This paper discusses several commonly used machine learning algorithms to predict charging behavior, including stay duration and energy consumption based on historical charging records.It is noted that prediction error increases along with the rise of data entropy or thedecreaseofdatasparsity.Thus,thispaperaccountsforbothindicatorsbydefiningtheentropy/sparsityratio(R).When R islow, support vector regression (SVR) andrandomforest (RF) regression show betteraccuracy for stay duration and energy consumption predictions, respectively.

While R is high, a diffusion-based kernel densityestimator (DKDE) performs better for both predictions. The three methods are assembled as the proposed EnsemblePredictingAlgorithm(EPA)toimprovepredictingperformancebydecreasing11 % ofthedurationand 22 %of the energy consumption prediction errors.The prediction results are then applied to an optimal EV charging scheduling algorithm to minimize load variance while reducing the EV charging cost.A numerical simulation using real charging data is conducted to show the effectiveness of improved predictions and EV load management.The results show that the charging scheduling combined with EPA prediction can reduce 27% of peak load, 10% of load variation, and 4% cost reduction, compared to uncoordinated charging.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113732Received 17 April 2019; Received in revised form 1 August 2019; Accepted 11 August 2019☆This document is a collaborative effort.

Cur- rently, there are over 614 thousand EVs on the road in California [2], spurred by the government’s zero-emission vehicle mandate to achieve the goal of accommodating 1.5 million EVs by 2025 (California Ex- ecutive Order B-16-2012). Therefore, a sharply increasing number of EVs on the road is foreseen.However, the increasing number of EVs also means that the rise of energy demand and is now becoming a challenge to the electricity grid.Based on the EV charging data col- lected on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, the average energy consumption is about 8 kWh per charge, which is si- milar to a daily household energy demand.EV charging load often shows two peaks in a day, one in the morning when people plug in the EVattheworkplaceandtheotherintheeveningwhenpeoplegethome from work.

Without proper energy management for EV charging, the huge power demanddue toalargenumber of plugged-inEVscanstress the distribution grid, degrade the power quality [3,4], and impact the wholesale electricity market [5]. The AAA Foundation report reveals that US drivers spend only 0.8h in average behind the wheel everyday [6]and mostly leave vehicles parked.This implies that EVs can have a great flexibility for charging and is it not necessary to start charging right after plugged-in.Thus EV charging scheduling plays an important role in distributing and allocating the charging time according to the EVs’ availability for overall load management.A proper EV load man- agement not only mitigates the adverse effects of EV charging but also brings benefits to the grid such as load valley filling and peak shaving [7].Also EV as a mobile battery has a potential to participate in elec- tricity market [8].

Yet, the stochasticity of EV user charging behaviors, including start time, stay duration, and energy demand, poses a sig- nificant challenge for the management of charging scheduling. There- fore, this paper discusses and compares several commonly used pre- dictionmethods,aimingatdevelopinganaccuratepredictingmodelfor EVuserbehaviorinordertoimproveenergymanagementperformance.In addition, since the predicting methods, such as regression or kernel density estimator (KDE) are based on the historical data and the his- toricalchargingpatternsmaybeverydifferentfromeachother,thereis no one-size-fits-all predicting method for all different EV users.Thus,this paper analyzes and classifies the different charging patterns, and uses different predicting algorithms accordingly.Forecasting EV load and it’s impact to a distribution grid has re- cently been brought to light by the development of smart grids and the growing number of EVs.

However, due to limited access to real EV charging data, synthetic data from travel surveys are used for the ma- jority of these studies. Gennaro et al.[9]utilized the data collected from conventional fuel vehicles.Harris et al.[10]synthesized EV chargingprofilebyusingvehicletripdatafromtheNationalHousehold Travel Survey (NHTS).Wang et al.[11]simulated EV energy con- sumption using car travel survey.In spite of the early stage of EV adoption,someutilitiesandaggregatorshavebeencollectingdatafrom charging stations to gain insight into EV user behavior [12,13].EA Technology [14]haveconductedathreeyearprojecttocollectdataand investigate the impact of clusters of EVs on the electricity grid in theUK.There are two types of data can be used for the forecasting, which are station record and charging record.Station record comes directly from the measurement at the charging outlets while charging record comes from the measurement of each user’s charging session.

In other words, station record is the aggregated load data over time and char- ging record is the data for a specific user during a charging session. In [15], multiple methods including a k-nearest neighbor (KNN), a lazy- learning algorithm and a pattern sequence algorithm have been eval- uated for aggregated EV load estimation.In [16,17], an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method has been proposed foraggregated EV load forecasting.In [18], a data mining model was de- velopedtopredictEVchargingdemandforageographicalarea.In [19], modifiedpattern-basedsequenceforecasting(MPSF)wasincomparison with KNN, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) algorithms and showed more accurate performance.Also, the ag- gregateddataofEVloadsmaybeusedforcoordinatingtheEVcharging operation as in [20].However, to schedule the charging when EVs are plugged in, the charging parameters in each session are preferred in-stead of the aggregated load information.

Furthermore, the prediction by aggregated load requires a large amount of EV charging data and currently the availability of the data is limited. The author in [21] discussed EV charging load forecasting by using station records andcharging records, and the results showed that charging record based prediction is faster and more accurate.The method such as Gaussian- based kernel density estimator (GKDE) has been applied to handle the uncertainties of user behaviors for each charging session in [22–24].But the use of optimal bandwidth selection for GKDE, a.k.a the normalreference rule [25], usually leads to an oversmoothed probability and results in less accurate prediction.

Chung, et al. Applied Energy 254 (2019) 113732 2normal reference rule, kernal density estimation via diffusion (DKDE) [26], which provides a better bandwidth selection approach, has been used to improve the prediction accuracy of EV charging behavior [27,28].Byexamining the performance of the algorithmsapplied to EV user behavior prediction, it is noted that the variances of the errors are usually large.This is because the EV charging patterns vary sig- nificantly and there is no unique algorithm that works for all.Ref.[28] compares and discusses DKDE and GKDE, and the result shows thatDKDE has a higher accuracy for the users who charge their EVs reg- ularlywhile GKDE worksbetter for the irregulars.However,the overall performance for the prediction still has room for improvement.To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is no effective feature that can categorize different EV charging patterns associated with the most ac- curate predicting algorithms.

Therefore, this paper aims at classifying different charging patterns and uses the best approach to predict the charging behavior in each classification. Therestof the paperisorganized asfollows:Section 2describesthe method for EV user behavior prediction and reviews commonly used machine learning algorithms.Section 3presents the EV charging schedulingframework.Section 4discussestheEVchargingdatasetsand data processing.Section 5shows the preliminary results and the pro- posed algorithm.Section 6presents and discusses the result.Finally, Section7concludes the paper.2.User behavior prediction This section describes the method for EV user behavior prediction.The objective is to predict each specific EV user’s stay duration and energy demand based on their historical charging data when they plug in their EVs.

For each charging session, a 5-tuple of parameters is used to describe a charging behavior: s u t t d e ( , , , , ),id s d w (1) where uid istheuniqueidentifier(user ID)foreachuserinoursystem; ts and tddenote start time andstay duration,respectively; dw denotes day of week; and edenotes energy consumption. Those charging parameters are of vital of importance for EV charging scheduling algorithms to de- termine an optimal solution.To be specific, once a user initiates a chargingsession,thepredictionsof stay duration andenergy consumption are required for the scheduling services to determine energy allocationschedule.It is noted that stay duration is related to start time andday of weeksince users in our model may have their fixed weekly working schedules.Therefore, the prediction of stay duration( t^d ) can be ex- pressed as follows: =t f t d^( , ).

d d s w (2) Also, energy consumption isrelatedto start time, day of week,and stay duration, such that: =e f t d t ( , ,^).es w d (3) As shown in (3), when predicting energy consumption, the stay durationis unknown and thus rely on its predicted value, t^d . To gain better prediction accuracy, this paper analyzes several different pre-diction algorithms aiming at finding the best predictors, i.e.fd and fe, for each user.The predicting procedure is illustrated in Fig.1.Because the charging pattern varies from each other, there is no one-size-fits-all predictor for all EV users.Therefore, in this paper, EVusers charging patterns will be classified, and eight different prediction algorithms will be applied to those different classes for comparison to find the optimal solution.To evaluate the performances of different prediction algorithms, symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) is chosen here based on the following reasons: 1.

SMAPE is a unit free percentage error and it is easier to present the prediction accuracy with different data sets, which are stay durationandenergy consumption in this paper. 2.Percentage error such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, defined as MAPE=mean y y y( / ) ) has a problem when y value becomes very small.This small value will result in a huge error thatbias the overall accuracy.Therefore, SMAPE would be more accu- rate since it considers both yand y in the denominator, given that the data is strictly positive.3.SMAPE is widely used in evaluating EV charging prediction accu- racy, it would be easier for comparison.For charging session i, the SMAPE is defined as: = +=SMAPE iNP i T i P i T i( )1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ), iN 1 (4) where Nisthenumberofchargingsessions, P istheprediction,and Tis the corresponding true value.2.1.Machine learning algorithms Eight prediction algorithms are reviewed here in the following sub- sections.

By examining the EV charging data, the data can be roughly classified into four categories: linear, non-linear, clustered, and scat- teredpatterns.Multiplelinearregressionissuitableforalinearpattern. SVRcanpredictbothlinearandnon-linearpatternsandisnotbiasedby outliers.Decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) regression are appro- priate forclusteredpatterns.RF canbe moreaccuratethanDT sinceDT may easily leadto over-fitting.However, it is requiredto determine the propernumber of treesfor RF.KNN regressioncan alsobeapplied for a clusteredpattern.Scatteredpatternischallengingforprediction.Inthis case, GKDE and DKDE are used to find the probability density function and make a prediction by calculating the expected value.A statistical methodisappliedhereforcomparison.Thesealgorithmsarecompared, and their effectivenesses are evaluated for different EV charging pat- terns.2.1.1.

Statistical method Statistical method such as historical average are referred to as a naive approach, and it is a simple algorithms that used only for com- parisonwiththeotherforecastingtechniques.Forthehistoricalaverage algorithm, the prediction is the average of the past data. 2.1.2.Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) MLR is used to describe the mathematical relationship between severalexplanatoryvariablesandaresponsevariable,andthegoalisto make predictions about the response variable based on the known ex- planatory variables according to this relationship.For example, to predict a stay duration based on the start time andday of week.

The model of MLR with kexplanatory variables and nobservations is as follows: = + + …+ + = …y b b x b x b x e for i n 1, 2, ,i i i k ik i 0 1 1 2 2 (5) where yiistheresponsevariable, b0 isthey-interceptterm, … b b b[ , , , ] k 1 2 are the regression coefficients, … x x x[ , , , ]i i ik1 2 are explanatory variables and is the error term, which is also known as residual that is used to Fig. 1.User behavior prediction.Y.-W.Chung, et al.Applied Energy 254 (2019) 113732 3account for the difference between the actual outcome and the pre- diction.Inthispaper,for stay duration prediction, xi1 isstart time and xi2 isday of week ( =k 2).For energy consumption, xi1 isstart time, xi2 isday of week,and xi3 isstay duration( =k 3 ).Here we use the Python package (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) [29]for the MLR model.2.1.3.Support Vector Regression (SVR) SVR is a type of support vector machine that supports linear and non-linear regression.

Unlike general linear regression methods, whichtry to minimize the error between the prediction and data, SVR makes sure the errors do not exceed the threshold. Specifically, in -SVR[30], the goal is to find a function y x( ) that has at most deviation from the obtainedtargets yi forthetrainingdata,ignoringtheoutliersthatlocate outside of the -tolerence band.Consider a training dataset … x y x y{( , ), , ( , )} n n 1 1 , where denotes the space of the input data, SVR can be expressed as follows: = + y x x b with b ( ) , , , (6) where an b are the solutions of the following optimization problem: + + + + += y x b x b ymin subject to, , , 0.w bin i i i i i i i i ii, ,1 22 1 (7) InEq.(7),slackvariables ,ii areintroducedtohandletheproblem of infeasible -precision constraints.The constant >0 controls the trade-off between the flateness of y x( ) (which is 2 ) and the number of training data points that deviate larger than is tolerated.

This op- timization problem can be solved by Lagrange multipliers method and the solution is given by = = + = =x and f x k x x b ( ) ( ) , , in i i i in i i i 1 1 (8) where ,i i areLagrangemultipliersinwhich C x , [0, ], ( ) i i i isa transformation function, and = k x x x x( , ): ( ), ( ) i i is a kernel func- tion. The kernel function transforms the data into a higher dimensionalfeature space to make it possible to perform the linear regression.The Gaussion radial basis function (RBF) is used here as a kernel function: = k x x e( , ) , ix x 2i2 2 (9) where isthe kernelparameter.ThedetailoftheSVRformulation can be found in [31].In this paper, we use the Python package (sklearn.svm.svr) [29]for the SVR model.2.1.4.

Decision tree (DT) regression Decision tree (DT) regression is a regression model in the form of a tree structure that breaks down a dataset into smaller classified subsets usingeachoftheindependentvariables’splitpoints.Theaverageofthe classified subset is the prediction value for the target with respect to its corresponding independent variable values. The classified subsets are called leaf nodes whereas the split points are decision nodes.For each decision node, mean square error (MSE) are compared across the in- dependentvariablesandthevariable/pointrenderingthelowestMSEis chosen as the root node/decision node.The process is recursively continued until the optimal split of the data is achieved, which is de- fined in terms of tree size constraints within the Python package (sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor) [29]used in this paper.2.1.5.

Random Forest (RF) Regression Random forest (RF) regression is an ensemble learning method that combines and averages decisions from a sequence of DT models.Formally, RF regression can be expressed as follows: = =g xNf x ( )1( ), treeiN i 1tree(10) where g x( ) is the RF model, f x( )i is the ith DT model, and Ntree is the number of decision trees. Each f x( )i is built from a sample drawn with replacement from the training dataset.By using the average of the multiple DT models on the corresponding sub-samples of the dataset, the predictive accuracy can be improved.Here we use the Python package (sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor) [29]for the RF model.2.1.6.K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Regression K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression [32].The regression model is used since the data labels are continuous instead of discrete variables.

The model implements learning based on the k-nearest neighbors of each query point, where =k 4 is specified in this paper. The prediction of a query pointistheaverageofitsnearestneighbors,anditisassumedthateachneighbor contributes uniformly to the classification of the query point.Here we use the Python package (sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor) [29]for the KNN model.2.1.7.Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) Kernel density estimator (KDE) is an nonparametric estimation method that does not require explicit parametric model to fit the data.Different from the above-mentioned regression methods, a bi-variate KDE makes use of the joint probability distribution of start time vs.stay durationandstay duration vs.energy consumption to predict stay duration andenergy consumption, respectively.To estimate a random variable X i e, ..x, given a joint probability function p x y( , ) , the expected value is calculated: = = = x E X x p x dx x p x y dy dx [ ] · ( ) · , · .

X X Y (11) For example, to predict stay duration d for a specific user, the joint distribution of start time t( )s vs.stay duration t( )d is used and the uni- variate distribution for dis calculated by: = =+p t p t t dt p t t dt( ) , , , dts d st tt t s d s s ss (12) where ts isthetoleranceintervalofstart time ts andissetto2hinthis paper from t 1 s to +t 1 s( =t1). The estimated stay duration ( td) is the expected value within this interval.Similarly, the energy demand( e ) is estimated by the distribution of stay duration ( td) vs.energy con- sumption(e) according to the estimated stay duration ( td) and the toler- ance interval ( td ) so that: = =+p e p t e dt p t e dt ( ) , , td dt tt t d d d dd (13) In this paper, =t 2 d where =t1 .

Gaussion-Based Kernel Density Estimator(GKDE) Given an ob- served dataset = …X X X X [ , , , ] N 1 2 , the probability density function can be estimated as follows [33]: = =P xNhKx X h( )1, iN i GKDE 1 (14) where Nisthe sizeof X h, isthebandwidthoftheGaussiankernel K(·) which is defined as: = K u u ( )1 2exp1 2.2 (15) Bandwidth hdefines the shape of the kernel function, thus it is a deterministic factor to the performance of the estimator. A large h oversmoothes the density function that masks the structure of dataY.-W.Chung, et al.Applied Energy 254 (2019) 113732 4while a small hgenerates a spiky one that makes the interpretation difficult.It is desired to find a value of hthat minimizes the error be- tween the estimated density andthe actual density.However, there is a bias-variance trade-off for the bandwidth selection, which means a large bandwidth reduces the variance of P x ( ) KDE but increases the bias with respect to the actual density.

On the other hand, a small band- width decreases the bias of P x ( ) KDE at the expense of larger variance. Silverman’s rule of thumb [25], also known as the normal reference rule, provides a simple solution for the optimal bandwidth, with the assumption that the actual density has Gaussian normal distribution.But,thismethodusuallyleadstoanoversmoothedresultinmultimodal models such as EV user charging behaviors.Diffusion-Based Kernel Density Estimator(DKDE) Different from the normal reference rule, the optimal bandwidth can be derived from theobserveddataset Xusinganimprovedplug-inmethodintroducedin [26].The KDE of (14)can be expressed in an alternative form: = =P x tNx X t ( ; )1( , ; ), diff iN i diff KDE 1 (16) where = x X ttx X t( , ; )1 2exp( ) 2, i diff diffi diff2 (17) in which = t hdiff is defined as in (14).

It is interesting to note that GKDE in (16)is the unique solution to the Fourier heat equation as follows [26]: = >tP x txP x t x t ( ; )1 2( ; ), , 0, , diff diff diff2 2 (18) with initial condition: = =P xNx X ( ;0)1( ), iN i 1 (19) where P x( ;0) represents the empirical density of X, and x X( ) i is the Dirac measure at Xi . The Neumann boundary condition is as follows: = = = =tP x ttP x t ( ; )| ( ; )| 0.diff x diff x 1 0 (20) Making use of the link between GKDE and Fourier heat equation, finding the optimal bandwidth of (16)is equivalent to finding the op- timal mixing time t of the diffusion process governed by (18).Considering all these conditions and the finite domain [0, 1] , the analytical solution of (18)is obtained by: = =P x tNx X t x ( ; )1( , ; ) 0, 1 ,diff iN idiff DKDE 1 (21) in which the kernel function is given by: = + + =x X t x k X t x k X t for x( , ; ) ( , 2 ; ) ( , 2 ; ) [0, 1].idiff kidiff idiff (22) 3.EV charging scheduling 3.1.

Model description The Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) is controlled and managed by a control entity (CE). The purpose of CE is twofold: minimizing the peak load, which is equivalent to load variance mini- mization, as well as reducing total charging cost [34].The EVCI is suppliedbyan electricalfeedershared withan officebuilding whichits average net load demand is 318kW.Let’s denote the total number of EVs and EV chargers (EVCs) by and , respectively, where , .In this paper, each EVC has four charging outlets and can charge four EVs at the same time, so we use lto show the set of EVs supplied by EVC l .The model of EVCI and the building can be written as: + = + = … z t z t T u t j( 1) ( ) ( ), 1, , ;j j h j (23a) = + =e t d t u t( ) ( ) ( ), CIB B jj 1 (23b) where z t u t e t d t ( ) , ( ), ( ), ( )j j j CIB B and t .z t( )jin [kWh] is the energy stored in EV e t, ( )j CIB in [kW] is the total net load demand of the EVCI and the building.

d t( )B in [kW] is the load demand of the building. In (23a), Th (in hours [h]) is the discretization in time, e.g.=T 0.5 h corresponds to 30min in this paper.u t( )j , which is the EV charging power, is introduced as the optimization variable.u t( )j is positive in the charging mode and it is negative in discharging mode, a.k.a vehicle to grid (V2G) function.However, V2G is not discussed in this paper.The constraints on the energy capacity of EVs are: = … C t z t C t j( ) ( ) ( ), 1, , ,j j j (24) where C t( )j and C t( )j are the bounds on the energy stored in EVs.The constraintsonchargingpowerofEVsandtheircorrespondingEVCsare: = … u u t u j ( ) , 1, , ; j j j (25a) = … =g t u t g t l( ) ( ) ( ), 1, , ,l ll l 1l (25b) where uj and ujare the minimum and maximum power ratings of the EV charging outlet, and gl and glare the minimum and maximum power ratings of the EVCs.

The bounds in (24)for EVs are time-varying and defined as follows; if = … EV j, 1, ,j is: •not plugged in EVC, = = C t C t( ) ( ) 0j j •plugged in EVC, but it is in idle mode, = = C t C t C( ) 0 & ( )j j j •plugged in EVC, and it is needed by time = = t C t C t C, ( ) ( )j j j where Cj is the maximum capacity of EV j ’s battery. 3.2.Problem formulation For the given time index tand prediction horizon H , let’s denote the vector notation = + … + u t u t u t H u u ( ( ), ( 1), , ( 1)) , j j j jTj t( )H , which is used for all other variables as well.To formulate the objective function, we define total net load demand at time tby(26): d.B (26) Also, the average net load demand at time tover time horizon H is: =+ H1.t kk H 1 (27) Accordingly, the twofold objective function of EV coordinated charging (CC) is written as: = + + = =V u u : min ( ) s.t.(23)–(25),jTj jj u1 12 (28) where is a weighting factor, and H is time of use (TOU) price vector[35].

The first part in (28)reduces charging cost, while the second part minimizes the total load variance.Y.-W. Chung, et al.Applied Energy 254 (2019) 113732 54.Data preparation 4.1.Data Two sources of EV charging data were applied to this research, in- cluding SMERC charging stations on the UCLA campus [12]as working spaceandrealresidentialEVusers’dataintheUKthatisavailablefrom theEAtechnologywebsite [14].ThedatausedfromtheUCLAcharging stations was recorded from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 and the data from the EV technology between February 16, 2014 and No- vember 29, 2015.However, not every user in those datasets has a charging history that is long enough for data analysis and prediction.Therefore, we selected 50 users’ data from UCLA and 202 form EV technology, which have at least 100 charging records, with 39,458 recordsintotal.Thedatawassplitinto70 % forthetrainingset,20 % for the validation set, and 10 % for the test set.

The statistics for charging start time, stay duration, and energy con- sumption are shown in the figures below. Fig.2shows two peaks for EV charging start time:oneat7:30inthemorningandthe otherat17:30in the evening.The average stay duration is 3h, and the average energy consumption is 10.63 kWh, as shown in Figs.3and4, respectively.4.2.Data preprocessing Thecharging start time andstay duration wereconvertedtohour.For instance, 13:15 will be noted as 13.25h.If a stay duration was smaller than 0.5h or an energy consumption was smaller than 1 kWh, the entire 5-tuple parameter for that charging session was removed from the da- taset.Also, if an energy consumption was mistakenly recorded as more than the physical maximum of the charging device, the record valuewasreplacedbythemaximumvalueofitshistorical energy consumption.4.3.Data entropy Joint entropy is used here to characterize the uncertainty of a set of variables.Two kinds of datasets were analyzed, which are start time vs.

durationdata and durationvs.energy consumption data. For calculation, start time anddurationare rounded to the closest half hour, and the energy consumption is rounded to the closest integer.The values of start timeanddurationarethenmappedintoasetofintegers [0, 47] ,which represents [0: 00, 23: 30] .The formulation of a joint entropy is as fol- lows: = E X Y P x y log P x y , , , , x y2 (29) where xandyare the two variables in dataset XandY, respectively; P x y( , ) is the joint probability of the two variables.4.4.Data sparsity Sparsityisdefinedasthenumberofzeroentriesdividedbythetotal numberofentries.Intuitively,ifasparsityishighthedataislessvariantbecause most entries are repeated.On the other hand, for low sparsity, the data is more scattered.As was the data entropy discussed in the previous section, start time vs.duration data and duration vs.energy consumption data are analyzed.The values of start time, duration, and energy consumption are rounded.

Following are the examples of sparsity calculation:In Fig.5,thenumbersinthecellsarethenumbercountsfor thedatapoints.For start time vs.duration,the start time rangesfrom0to 23 while the durationfrom 0 to 9. The number of non-zero entries is 31 and the total eneries is 240, thus the sparsity is (240–31)/240 =0.87.In the same manner, the sparsity for durationvs.energy consumptuon is 0.89.5.Preliminary results and proposed algorithm 5.1.Preliminary results Figs.6and7show the comparisons of eight algorithms’ prediction errors with regard to data entropy, data sparsity and the ratio of en- tropy/sparsity (R).Generally, SMAPE positively correlates to data en- tropy and negatively correlates to data sparsity.Therefore, this paper takesintoaccountbothoftheeffectsofentropyandsparsitybydefining theratio: =R entropy /sparsity.SDandDErepresentthedatasetsof Start timevs.Duration and Duration vs.Energy Consumption, respectively.

DKDE is the best when R_SD > 5.5 and the SMAPE does not change significantly in different R_SD categories. Table 2shows the energy consumption prediction results of the dif- ferent algorithms.RF is shown to be the most accurate overall, espe-cially when R_DE 4.Similarly, DKDE performs the best when R_DE > 4.5.2.Proposed algorithm Based on the preliminary results, the combination of SVR, RF, and DKDE isproposedtoformanensemblealgorithm,namelythe EPA.The algorithm is depicted in Fig.10below.Data entropyand sparsity are analyzed for all registered EV usersin the system in order to calculate the R value.When an EV is plugged in,theuser’sR_SDisretrievedtodetermineeitherSVRor DKDEtobeused for predicting stay duration.The predicted stay duration is then sent to thenextstepfor energy consumption prediction.Similarly,RForDKDEis applied depending on the value of R_DE.The threshold of R to switch the algorithms may need to update quarterly since user behaviors may change over time.

The EPA is evaluated using a 10 % test dataset. The prediction results along with the EV scheduling results are presented in the next section.6.Results and discussion Figs.11and12show the SMAPE with regard to R for durationand energy consumption predictions, respectively.Fig.11illustrates the comparison between SVR and DKDE.As shown in the figure, the SMAPE of SVR is smaller when R_SD is smaller than 5.5, whereas the SMAPE of DKDE is smaller when R_SD is larger than 5.5.Fig.12de- monstrates the comparison between RF and DKDE.As expected, RF is more accurate when R_DE is smaller than 4, while DKDE performs better when R_DE is larger than 4.Table 3shows the average andstandard deviation for the SMAPEof durationandenergy consumption predictions.A pairwise T-test with the null hypothesis that the EPA has the same performance as the other Fig.5.Sparsity of EV charging patterns.left:start time vs.duration,right:duration vs.energy consumption.Fig.

Using EPA prediction results, we run CC for the EVCI including 252 EVs and 63 EVCs. TOU used in our numerical simulation is shown in Fig.13.Total charging profiles of the EVCI for uncoordinated charging (uCC) and CC using real and prediction data are shown in Fig.14.As it is clear, CC flattens the total load profile which results in peak load shaving when TOU price is high and valley filling when TOU price is low.Also,thedifferencebetweenloadprofileusingEPAandrealdatais negligible during most of the time intervals.However, there appears a valleyduring 23:00 and4:00in Fig.14andisnotfilled.This isbecause of less availability of EVs according to our dataset, in which the “end Fig.7.Comparisons of SMAPE( % ) versus entropy, sparsity and R_DE (entropy/sparsity).Fig.8.Comparisons of different algorithms with DKDE for duration prediction.Y.-W.Chung, et al.

The coordinated and uncoordinated EV charging scheduling results with respect to peak-to-peak (PTP) and root-mean-square (RMS) of the load profile, and charging cost are shown in Table 5.The result of CC_EPAalignswellwithCC_Real,andreduces27%peakload,10%loadvariation, and 4% charging cost from that of uCC’s.Although the result shows only $10 can be saved per day by sche- duling 252 EVs’ charging comparing to uncoordinated charging, with alarge number of EVs, the saving can be significant.Furthermore, ac- cording to [36], the energy unit cost (EUC) negatively related to a load factor(LF) alongwithahyperbolicfunction( EUC LF 1/ ),whereLFis defined as follows: Fig.9.Comparisons of different algorithms with DKDE for energy consumption prediction.

The results show that the EPA model fits the true densities, in- cluding start time, stay duration, and energy consumption, better than theotheralgorithms.Therefore,thecontrolentity(CE)canscheduleEV charging optimally in terms of minimizing peak loads and reducing Fig. 11.Average SMAPE vs.R_SD for SVR and DKDE.Fig.12.Average SMAPE vs.R_DE for RF and DKDE.Table 3 SMAPE( % ), standard deviation (in parentheses), and the pairwise T-test result.Duration prediction Energy consumption prediction Algorithm SVR DKDE EPA RF DKDE EPA SMAPE (%) 11.53 (5.18) 11.67 (6.36) 10.40 (5.80) 9.69 (4.60) 9.56 (4.26) 7.54 (4.24) P-value 0.00964409 0.00833339 - 0.00182736 × 2.00649 1005 – Table 4MED (Duration: hour; Energy: kWh), standard deviation (in parentheses), and the pairwise T-test result.

It is founded that, in general, predicting SMAPEs positively correlate to data sparsity/entropy ratio (R) but this relationship for GKDE andDKDE is relatively weak. Therefore, the KDE method can be utilized to handle the high R data with lower predictionerror.Based on this property and the analysis result, SVR, RF, andDKDE are selected to compose the EPA.The synergy of the three al- gorithms enhances the prediction performance where SVR is good at predictingEVstayduration,RFperformsbetteronenergyconsumption estimation,andDKDEtakes careoftheprediction withthe highRdata.The estimations by EPA are then applied to the optimal EV charging scheduling algorithm for load variation and charging cost minimiza-tion.Owing to the increased accuracy of the prediction, the scheduling algorithm can provide better EV chargingload management in terms of reducing load variation and charging cost.

Real data is employed for a numerical simulation to demonstrate the improved prediction accuracy of EPA and validate the effectiveness of EV charging scheduling algo- rithm. TheproposedEPAalgorithmcanbeappliedtoanyscaleofcharging station, with an assumption that EVs’ charging records are known.However, to reach optimal scheduling within a distribution grid, the connection between each charging station is required.This can be achieved by adopting the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP), which is alreadyavailableonthemarket [38].Thedataentropyandsparsityare the data property that can be applied to other datasets.This paperpresents a preliminary result for how the different prediction algo- rithms relate to the property R.To apply the EPA to a different dataset, there is an advantage to use DKDE for high R data prediction since DKDE is not sensitive to the change of R.As for the methods for low R data, it would be different depending on the datasets.Fig.

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Transportation Research Part D journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/trd Exploring electric vehicle charging patterns: Mixed usage of charging infrastructure Jae Hyun Leea,⁎, Debapriya Chakrabortyb, Scott J.Hardmanb, Gil Talb aKorea Research Institute for Human Settlements, South Korea bPlug-In Hybrid & Electric Vehicle Research Center, Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Davis, United States ARTICLE INFO Keywords: Charging behavior Charging locationsElectric vehiclesPlug-in vehiclesABSTRACT This paper examines the charging behavior of 7,979 plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners in California.The study investigates where people charge be it at home, at work, or at public lo-cation, and the level of charging they use including level 1, level 2, or DC fast charging.

While plug-in behavior can di ﬀer among PEV owners based on their travel patterns, preferences, and access to infrastructure studies often make generalizations about charging behavior. In this study, we explore di ﬀerences in charging behavior among di ﬀerent types of PEV owners based on their use of charging locations and levels, we then identify factors associated with PEV owner ’s choice of charging location and charging level.We identi ﬁed socio-demographic (gender and age), vehicle characteristics, commute behavior, and workplace charging availability as signi ﬁcant factors related to the choice of charging location.1.Introduction Plug-in-electric vehicles (PEVs), which include Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are being adopted rapidly as an alternative to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.In contrast to ICE vehicles, PEVs can be refueled (charged) anywhere if an electrical outlet is available.Charging in the U.S.

is grouped into three categories based on charging power: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), and DC Fast. Level 1 provides charging through a 120-volt plug adding 2 to 5 miles of range per hour of charging (1.2– 1.8 kW AC), Level 2 charges a PEV through a 240- or 208-volt point adding 10 to 20 miles of range per hour of charging (3.6– 22 kW AC), and a DC Fast point can supply power up to 480-volt allowing 50 to 70 miles to be added per 20 min of charging (at 50 kW or more).Although a substantial amount of research has investigated PEV charging behavior and electricity consumption, most of the studies focused on time-of-day dynamics of PEV charging demand like start time, plug-in type, charging time, idle time, or charging location ( Hardman et al., 2018).Travel patterns and vehicle driving ranges primarily impact PEV owners ’charging needs.

Past studies have identi ﬁed four main locations at which charging occurs - overnight charging at or near home, at workplaces, at publicly accessible locations like those near grocery stores, shopping malls, and in parking lots; and on travel corridors where drivers stop between their trip origin and destination points ( Idaho National Laboratory, 2015; Ji et al., 2015; M. Nicholas et al., 2017; Nicholas and Tal, 2015 ).Though, multiple studies have tried to identify the optimal location for building infrastructure for PEVs, depending on the source and nature ofdata (stated or revealed) results can vary substantially ( Dong et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2015; Santini et al., 2014; Tal and Dunckley, 2016; Weiller, 2011).Combining stated preference survey with Global Positioning System (GPS) data, Nicholas et al.( 2017 ) found that the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2020.102249⁎Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: jaelee@krihs.re.kr (J.H.Lee), dchakraborty@ucdavis.edu (D.

In addition to con- venience, one factor that drives overnight home charging is the use of time-of-use (TOU) electricity tari ﬀs. A 2016 study in California found that these tari ﬀs, which provide cheaper electricity during the nighttime, encourage consumers to charge their vehicles at home overnight ( Tal and Dunckley, 2016 ).Overall, overnight home charging has the highest share of charging events among all locations- 50% to 80% of charging events for PEVs occur at home ( California ’s Advanced Clean Cars Midterm Review Appendix G: Plug-in Electric Vehicle In-Use and Charging Data Analysis, 2017; Franke and Krems, 2013 ).However, this dominance of home charging di ﬀers in situations where consumers do not have access to home charging.Workplace or commute location charging is the next most favorable option among PEV owners (Björnsson and Karlsson, 2015; Figenbaum and Kolbenstvedt, 2016; Nicholas and Tal, 2015; Skippon and Garwood, 2011 ).According to Tal et al.

( Nicholas and Tal, 2013 ) a signi ﬁcant driver for charging at work was employers providing charging for free. Also, workplace charging is more important for BEV owners than PHEV owners who can rely on the ICE driving mode of their car when the battery is depleted ( Nicholas and Tal, 2015).Approximately 15– 20% of the charging events occur at the workplace for BEV owners.Publicly accessible charging locations in shopping malls or parking lots and those located on travel corridors are the least usedcharging locations at present.Only approximately 5% of the charging events occur at these locations.In spite of the low share of charging events at these locations, public infrastructure is still required to encourage adoption of the PEVs as it o ﬀers a safety net to BEV owners on longer trips( Dong et al., 2014; Morrissey et al., 2016; M.Nicholas et al., 2017; Plötz and Funke, 2017; Tal et al., 2014).In recent years, DC fast charging options are being o ﬀered in public charging stations.

These chargers are generally more important for long-range BEV owners since they are more likely to use their car for longer trips ( Figenbaum and Kolbenstvedt, 2016; Ji et al., 2015; Neaimeh et al., 2017; Nicholas and Tal, 2017; Nicholas et al., 2013 ). Publicly-available fast charging options can reduce range anxiety and encourage adoption of PEVs.Research on charging levels typically ﬁnds that L1 or L2 charging is preferable in locations with long dwell times, such as home or at work and that DC fast charging is used for long distance trips ( Dong et al., 2014; Figenbaum and Kolbenstvedt, 2016 ).L1 charging results in slow charging times, which may not be an issue with small battery BEVs and PHEVs, however it may not be su ﬃcient for longer range BEVs when charging at home, depending on their daily travel patterns (M.A.Nicholas et al., 2017b).

Consumers can charge at home, work, and in public locations, they could charge at only one of these locations, some combination of two locations, or all three locations. In this study.we aim to investigating why consumers charge their vehicles at any of thepotential locational combinations.Along with the choice to use any combination of charging locations, PEV owners also have a choice of charging levels at some of these locations.To accurately model the e ﬀect of statewide or nationwide PEV charging demands on future infrastructure needs and on the power grid, it is important to understand the usage pattern of L1, L2, and DC Fast chargers at relevant locations like home, work, and public.In addition, it is critical to understand the factors driving this charging behavior and choice of charging location.The literature related to charging behavior and use of chargers have often considered the importance of public, workplace, and home infrastructure in isolation.

However, in reality the infrastructure is often used in an integrated way with PEV owners plugging in at multiple locations to satisfy their charging needs. We were unable to identify any studies that investigate the combined choice of charging locations.Better understanding of how the charging infrastructure is used by PEV owners and the factors characterizing this behavior will be particularly important when we develop policies for future PEV buyers.It will be possible to forecast better their usage of charging infrastructure based on the charging environment, their demographic character- istics, and travel behavior.Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to identify the di ﬀerent locational charging patterns of PEV owners, focusing on the usage of di ﬀerent types of chargers at di ﬀerent locations.

Subsequently, using a multinomial logit model we explore the e ﬀects of socio-demographic, vehicle characteristics, and access to charging facilities on the choice of charging infrastructure. The multinomial model despite the restrictive Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption allows us to obtain an approximate estimate of the factors that drive charging behavior among PEV owners.2.Data The data used in this study is drawn from a cohort survey of PEV owners in California conducted in the years 2016 and 2017.Participants who owned at least one PEV were recruited based on Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) registration data and the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program (CVRP) database using a random sampling procedure.The response rate for the completed survey was about 15%.There were six categories of questions on: travel behavior, driving behavior, vehicle performance, vehicle characteristics, response to PEV related incentives, and charging behavior.

For charging behavior, we asked the respondent to provide 7-days of charging history and answer if their PEV was charged at the following locations with the given types of chargers: Level 1 Home Level 2 Home Level 1 Work Level 2 Work DC Fast charger WorkJ.H. Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 2Level 1 Public, referring to non-home and non-work locations (e.g.public chargers, highway corridor chargers, Tesla super- chargers) Level 2 Public DC Fast charger Public For each day, a respondent must indicate which of the above option they used.In addition, we also asked them to record whether charging at work was paid or free, the type of electricity plan, and what they estimate is the cost of charging at home, membership ofcharging network companies, and the characteristics of their workplace and home charging infrastructure.

In this study, from the pool of survey respondents we analyze a sub-sample of 7,979 PEV owners who charge at least once during the 7-days for which the charging history has been reported. Considering the market penetration of PEVs, many current owners are still early adopters of the technology.As observed in the case of other technologies, early adopters may have some unique characteristics –age- group, education level, household income, technology awareness among others.Descriptive statistics of the sample of PEV owners analyzed here are presented in Table 1.More than 80% of households in the sample have income higher than the median income in California ($77,359 according to the Census American Community Survey 1-year survey 2017) and the percentage of people with graduate or professional degrees is48.7% (California statewide 12.3%).Our dataset contains more males who are the primary user of the PEV, and the sample has slightly more BEV owners than PHEV owners.

More than 80% of respondents owned homes that are detached units. The sample is dominated by a few PEV models; about 50% of respondents with BEVs have the Chevrolet Bolt, Tesla Model S or the Nissan Leaf, and a considerable number of the PHEV households own the Prius plug-in hybrid or the Chevrolet Volt.Fig.1 shows the di ﬀerence in charging behavior between BEV and PHEV users as observed in the data.Overall, BEV owners use Level 2 chargers at home (about 40% of charging events) slightly more than PHEV owners (less than 30%).The frequency of home charging behavior does not appear to be a ﬀected by the day of the week.Work charging was signi ﬁcantly reduced during the weekend for both BEV and PHEV users, presumably because few respondents work on the weekends.The number of BEV users whodid not charge during a particular day was twice that of the PHEV users.

This di ﬀerence is perhaps due to the longer electric driving ranges of BEVs allowing for multiple days of travel to be completed on one charge. Whereas for PHEV owners, if they wish to drivetheir vehicle using electric propulsion they will need to charge everyday assuming they have typical commute distances.3.Methodology First, we classify respondents in our sample into distinct groups based on their choice of charging location in the 7-day period.Second, we explore the relationship between choice of charging location and di ﬀerent PEV models during weekdays and weekends as well as investigate any spatial di ﬀerence in the choice of charging location.Finally, we use a regression model to identify the characteristics of the charging location groups.At all the stages of analysis, BEV and PHEV owners are studied separately.This is done due to the di ﬀerence in vehicle technology between BEVs and PHEVs and their charging needs.

Also, most BEVs in the market can use DC fast chargers whereas only one PHEV (Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV) can use DC fast charge. This restricts the choice of charginglocation for PHEV drivers and will impact their charging behavior.3.1.Locational charging patterns Using information on the choice of charging locations (Home, Work, and Public) over a period of 7- days, the following sevenTable 1 Descriptive statistics of the survey dataset.

A home charging event may not in all cases be a private charger in a driveway, though this is likely as most PEV owners ’live-in single-family homes. Other forms of home charging include chargers in private parking lots of multi-unit dwellings or chargers on the street side.Workplace chargers are where PEV buyers park their vehicle when they commute, typically at their workplace, but this could also be at a transit location or nearby parking garage.Public charging is perhaps the di ﬃcult to conceptualize.A public charger/charging event for survey takers is one when the vehicle was not plugged-in at home and not at their work.A public charger in a parkinggarage could be one person ’s home charger, another ’s work charger, and another ’s public charger.This is especially true in urban area with homes, workplaces, shops, restaurants, cafes etc.in close proximity.For the purpose of analysis, public charging events aredeﬁned as those that happen at non-home and non-work location/time.

If a household reported that they only charged at home on all 7- days, then it is classi ﬁed as Home-only . But if a household charged at home on 6 days and reported a public charging event on 1 day, it is classi ﬁed as Home-public.A household that charged their vehicle at home, work, and public locations (even once) during the 7-day period is considered in the Allgroup.3.2.Descriptive analysis of charging pattern The choice of charging location can di ﬀer by the type of PEV, primarily due to vehicle characteristics like electric range.For instance, long-range BEV owners (e.g.Tesla and Chevrolet Bolt) may not need to charge at their workplace or at public locations ifthey can fully charge the vehicle overnight at home and have a short commute.The spatial characteristics of a PEV owner ’s re- sidential location can also play a major role in determining the pattern of use as commute distance and access to public chargers candiﬀer between urban, sub-urban, and rural neighborhoods.

For example, households residing and commuting within urban neigh- borhoods may have greater charging opportunities than households residing in suburban and non-urban areas. Households in sub-urban and non-urban areas may have to depend more on home-charging.Thus, we use cross-classi ﬁcation tables to examine the relationships between charging behavior and PEV characteristics and the relation between charging patterns and spatial char-acteristics of the PEV owners ’residential locations.3.3.Model for choice of charging infrastructure use pattern We use a multinomial logit model to understand the factors driving the group classi ﬁcations.We divide the sample into two groups (BEV and PHEV owners) and estimate the logit model separately for the two groups.We use e ﬀect coding for the nominal dependent variable, 7 types of charging behavior, so that we can estimate parameters in terms of di ﬀerences from the average and not from a reference category ( Vermunt and Magidson, 2015).

With e ﬀect coding, the probability that a household belongs to category m is given as: ∑ =⎛ ⎝⎜= ∏ =⎞ ⎠⎟=+ ∗ = =ηlogPy mz Py mzββ z(| ) [( | ) ]mzi mM iMm pP mpip | 1' 1/0 1i ' (1) where mdenotes a charging group like Home-only orWork-public, p denotes the categories in the dependent variable ,Mdenotes the total number of charging behavior groups such that 1≤m≤M,ziare covariates and y is the outcome variable observed in the data. Note,∑==β 0mM mp1for 0≤p≤P, implying the sum of estimated parameters for each independent variable will be zero when summed over all the categories.As the denominator of the log function in equation (1)shows, with e ﬀect coding, the probability of belonging to category m is now compared with the average (geometric mean) of the probabilities of all M categories and not to a reference category.In this way, it is possible to identify the driving factors for all the charging behavior groups.

A major drawback of the multinomial logit model is the assumption of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). The IIA assumption is problematic particularly if the model estimates are used to make predictions or explain substitution behavior.Since the objective of this study is to only understand the e ﬀects of sociodemographic characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and workplace charging facilities on the pattern of infrastructure use, the multinomial logit model using e ﬀect coding is well-suited and the IIA assumption should not have a signi ﬁcant impact on the results i.e.the direction of e ﬀect of the factors ( Train, 2002).

We use the following 25 explanatory variables: household income, education, age, and gender (Female: 1) of the primary driver, usage of PEV within household, detached house ownership (Own detached home: 1, other: 0), ownership of solar panels, number of vehicles in the household, household size, number of drivers in the household, presence of multiple PEVs in the household, vehicle ﬂeet, age of PEV, workplace charger availability (Yes: 1, No: 0), electric range of PEV, free workplace charging (Yes:1, No: 0), having time limitation on workplace charging (Yes: 1, No: 0), number of workplace chargers, frequency of change in parking spots forcharging in a month, cost of electricity at home (cents per kWh), charging network membership, commute distance, availability of L1 public chargers within 300 m of residence for PHEV owners, availability of L2 public chargers within 300 m of residence for both samples, availability of DC Fast public chargers within 300 m of residence for BEV owners sample, urban neighborhood (Urban:1, other 0), and Tesla ownership (Yes: 1, No 0).

The Tesla ownership variable was only used for the BEV model.J.H. Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 54.Results 4.1.Descriptive analysis of charging behavior Fig.2 shows the proportion of respondents in each charging behavior group and their proportion by di ﬀerent PEV models.Overall, the proportion of people who rely only on home charging is more than half of the sample (53%).The second and third largest groups are the people who utilized workplace charging only and those who used public charging facilities together with home charging.These groups account for 16% and 13% of total PEV owners, respectively.In total, 86% of respondents (including Home- only, Home-work, Home-public , and All) charged from home indicating that home is the most common charging location chosen by PEV owners.The right-hand side of Fig.2 shows the proportion of charging behavior groups by di ﬀerent PEV models.

About half of the respondents only rely on home charging regardless of the PEV model. The proportion of Work-only andHome-work are comparable across most short-range (less than100 miles) BEV owners but there were a greater number of Nissan Leaf and BMW i3 BEV users inHome-public and Allgroups than other short range BEVs (e.g.Fiat 500e, Volkswagen e-Golf).The next most common location is workplace charging.About 30 –40% of BEV owners use workplace charging facilities, with most of them using the latter along with home charging.Less than 30% of PHEV owners use workplace charging, again most of them belonging to the Home-work group.After Home-work the next largest group of workplace charging users is the group that uses all three locations.A smaller group uses a combination of work and other chargers, and another uses only work charging.The public charginggroups are less prominent.The most prominent group that uses public is the Home-public group especially for BEV households.

The most unique charging behavior was found in Tesla users. More than half of Tesla users belonged to the Home-only group , a rate that is higher than short range BEVs, but comparable to the Chevrolet Bolt which is also a long-range BEV.Another area in which Tesla diﬀered from other BEVs was the Home-public group which was the largest in comparison to all other models of BEVs and PHEVs.ThisFig.2.Proportion of charging behavior groups by di ﬀerent PEV models.J.H.Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 6pattern could be a result of the access to free supercharger network enjoyed by Tesla owners (at the time of the survey) or the longer driving ranges of these vehicles which increases the likelihood of long-distance travel requiring public charging.As the survey may have an over-representation of certain groups of vehicle owners, we re-estimate the proportions using weighted data.The weights are calculated using data from the CVRP records.

The CVRP dataset contains information of about 200,000 plug-in vehicles that were sold between 2010 and 2017 in California. The purchase year and make of PEVs were used to calculate weights because model information is not available from CVRP dataset.The bottom chart of Fig.2 shows the weighted proportion of charging behavior groups by di ﬀerent PEV models.They are not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from the unweighted one except the proportion of Home-only group for short-range BEVs (Leaf and i3).A greater number of Leaf users are in the Home-only group of the weighted sample while there are fewer i3 BEV users in the same group.It is a possibility that the charging pattern observed in the weightedsample of BMW i3 users is related to the incentives and free charging provided by BMW in North America ( BMW, 2016 ).Along with charging location we also investigate choice of charging levels –L1, L2, or DC fast charging by di ﬀerent charging behavior groups.Fig.

3 illustrates the average number of PEV charging days using di ﬀerent levels of charging at home, work, and public locations during the weekdays and weekends by di ﬀerent charging behavior groups. Regardless of BEV owners ’charging behavior group L2 is the most frequently used charger at home and workplace while DC fast charger is used when charging in public locations.BEV users ’average number of charging days at home using L1 charger is 0.8 and L2 is 2.7 ( Fig.3a).These values can be interpreted as the proportion of L1 and L2 home chargers at BEV owners home locations because there is typically not more than onetype of charger at PEV owners ’homes.Despite BEV owners mostly using L2 chargers, there is still a considerable number of BEV owners who use L1 chargers at home.BEV owners in the Work-only group use mostly L2 charger, but they also use L1 and DC fast chargers.

People who rely only on public charging locations mostly use DC fast chargers (about 1.5 days in a week) or L2 chargers (about 0.8 times per week). TheHome-work group seems to utilize both charging locations in equal proportion, mainly a L1 charger at home and a L2 charger at work.On the other hand, Home-public orWork-public groups seem to be more dependent on home and workplace chargers (more than 2 days at these chargers) respectively, primarily using L2 chargers at home or work and DC Fast at public locations.The All group primarily utilize L2 chargers at home and workplace and are less dependent on charging at public locations using L2 or DC Fastchargers.Fig.3b show weekend charging behavior of BEV owners, and they are very similar to the weekdays ’pattern except for the workplace charging.PHEV owners ’charging behavior is illustrated in Fig.3c and d.PHEV owners tend to charge more often than BEV owners.

More than 60% of PHEV owners used L1 chargers at home while their main chargers at a workplace or public locations were L2 chargers.Like BEV users, people in Home-work group utilize both home and workplace charging infrastructure equally, mainly using L1 charger at home and L2 charger at work. PHEV owners in Home-public, Work-public , and Allgroups tend to mainly use the L1 chargers at home and L2 chargers at work.Like BEV owners, there are no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences between weekdays and weekend charging patterns of Fig.3.Proportion of usage of di ﬀerent level of chargers in within charging behavior group.J.H.Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 7PHEV owners except for less workplace charging.Fig.4 shows the distribution of the seven charging behavior groups for ﬁve diﬀerent types of built environment (urban core, urban district, urban neighborhood, suburban neighborhood, and non-urban) ( Clifton, 2016 ).

This typology of built environments was developed with multiple land use indicators including community design measures (densities of people, jobs, and housings) and regional accessibility measures (level of transit services and job accessibilities). More details can be found in the technical mem- orandum in 2017 National Household Survey California Add-on.While approximately 50% of the PEV owners in urban neighbor- hoods only charge at home, the dependence on home charging is more in suburban and non-urban locations.Further, the Work-only andWork-public group is signi ﬁcantly smaller in suburban and non-urban residential areas compared to urban neighborhoods.Here, we only consider residential location information to map the distribution.The build environment of the commute location can also inﬂuence the choice of charging location.

However, as the median commute distance is 11 miles in the sample, we assume that the urban density of the commute location is not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from residential density and present only the spatial distribution of charging behavior groups by the type of build environment of the residential locations. Fig.5 shows the distribution of the di ﬀerent behavioral groups in the state of California.Analogous to the location choice pattern based on build environment ( Fig.4), the share of the Home-work, Home-other, Work-only, and Work-other group is closely related to the proximity of the PEV owner ’s residential location to major urban/employment centers in the state.Focusing on the Bay area and Southern California, we observe that the share of the Work-only andWork-public group is high in dense urban locations of the Bay area and Southern California like San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles where PEV owners may have higher access to workplace andpublic charging opportunities.

On the other hand, PEV owners in the sub-urban and non-urban areas of the state like the Mendocino county in Northern California or Kern county in the south mostly belonged to the Home-only and Home-public group. 4.2.Logistic regression results 4.2.1.BEV model estimation Table 2 shows the estimated parameters from the multinomial logit model for BEV owners.The model found that the Home-only group are more likely to be high-income, older, and owners of detached houses with solar cells, and have L2 charging facility at home.This group of BEV owners usually don ’t have access to workplace charging or membership with any network like ChargePoint or EVgo.They are more likely to have a special EV rate or TOU rate allowing them to pay a lower electricity rate per kWh.The Work- only group tends to have BEVs with shorter range, they are likely to have unlimited free workplace charging, and are more likely to need to swap their vehicles’ parking location while at work.

Swapping parking spaces at work allows one charge point to support more than one PEV throughout the day, thus reducing the issues of congestion and increasing the availability of workplace chargers to PEV owners. Unlike the Home-only group, BEV owners in this group are mostly apartment dwellers, renters, or residents of condominiums.However, like the Home-only group, the Work-only group are less likely to have a membership with any charging network.The Public-only group of BEV owners are more likely to be renters, apartment, or condominium residents and have a lower likelihood of having charging facility available at their workplace.The results however show that this group of BEV owners have ahigher likelihood of owning a Tesla.Due to their access to Tesla ’s supercharger network, this group of BEV owners can use public chargers to satisfy their charging needs.

Other potential reasons for belonging to the Public-only charging group are, being renters or residents of condominiums/apartments meaning they are less likely to have chargers at home. The logit model results also show that the BEV owners in this group on average have lower household incomes, though their average annual income of $163,000 is not low Fig.4.Land use characteristics and charging behavior by di ﬀerent types of land use.J.H.Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 8when compared to the average Californian household.Among the households using multiple locations for vehicle charging, BEV owners in the Home-work group are more likely to be owners of detached houses and have older BEVs with shorter driving ranges.Due to shorter driving ranges, drivers may be more motivated to utilize both L2 chargers at home and chargers available at work.

This group of BEV owners is likely to revise their home electricity rate plan as well as use free workplace chargers to lower the operating cost of their vehicle. As the results indicate, they are Fig.5.Distribution of charging behavior groups in California by county.J.H.Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 9less likely to be Tesla owners.Also, BEV owners in this group are less likely to have a membership of charging networks restricting them to home and workplace charging.BEV owners in the Home-public group are more likely to have lower income than the average BEV owner.However, they are more likely to be Tesla owners, have solar, and have L2 chargers at home.They are more likely to havemembership with a charging network.Workplace charging is less likely to be available to this group.BEV owners in the Work-public group and the Work-only group are similar to each other except for two characteristics.

The former is more likely to have membership to charging networks and have a higher likelihood of being apartment dwellers with public charger availability within 300 m of their multi-unit dwelling. Lastly, people who utilized all charging location are more likely to be young, own older BEVs, and have access to chargers at the workplace.4.2.2.PHEV model estimation Table 3 shows the estimated parameters from the multinomial logit model for PHEV owners.Overall, fewer parameters were signiﬁcant compared to the BEV model, though the characteristics that were signi ﬁcant are similar to the BEV model.The Home-only group for PHEV owners are more likely to be older, owners of detached house, and who own short range PHEVs (e.g.Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid).This group of PHEV owners do not have access to workplace charging facilities and if available it is not free, has time limits, and may have a lower guarantee of ﬁnding an available charger.

Like BEV owners, if the primary driver of the PHEV is a female then they are more likely to be in the Home-only group. PHEV owners in the Work-only group are also similar to the corre- sponding group among BEV owners (renters, apartment, and condominium dwellers with access to free or paid workplace charging and no charging limits).However, unlike BEV users, commute distance matters and PHEV owners in this group tend to commute shorter distance than other charging behavior groups.The Public-only group in PHEV owners are less likely to have access to free workplace charging or home L2 chargers.They also tend to use older PHEVs and have a lower number of vehicles in households.As aresult, this group of PHEV owners may be more reliant on their PHEV for short- as well as long-trips and thereby are more in- centivized to use public chargers to make the maximum use of the electric range of their vehicle.

Among PHEV owners who chose to charge their vehicle at multiple locations during the 7-day span, the PHEV owners in the Home-work group are like their BEV counterparts except they tend to use their vehicle for longer commutes. The PHEV owners in the Home-public group are more likely to have L2 chargers at home and have lower electricity rate than the average PHEV owner.This group of PHEV owners are less likely to have access to workplace charging.The Work- public group of PHEV owners are similar to the comparable group of BEV owners.Lastly, the Allgroup is more likely to have young PHEV drivers with access to L2 charger at home as well as chargers in their workplace.In terms of household characteristics, this group of PHEV drivers are more likely to have a larger household size and more vehicles, but a lower number of drivers in the households.Along with L2 charger at home this group of PHEV drivers are more likely to pay lower rate electricity at home.

Overall, the results of the two multinomial logit models show that infrastructure location choices are characterized by a range ofTable 2 Multinomial logistic regression results for BEV owners. Note: the coe ﬃcients colored with blue were positively signi ﬁcant at the level of 0.05, and red were negatively related at the level of 0.05.J.H.Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 10factors including socio-demographic characteristics like gender, income, and home ownership; vehicle characteristics like range and age of the vehicle; commute distance; electricity rate paid at home; and access to charging facility at home and workplace.Availability of workplace chargers plays an important role in determining the infrastructure use pattern, particularly when free.As the results of the logistic regression show, renters, apartment/condominium dwellers with limited or nonexistent charging at home do use their BEV for commuting when workplace charging is available.

Other PEV users with charging facilities at home also use workplace charging infrastructure especially when the residential electricity rate is high or workplace charging is free. Interestingly, commute distance is a signi ﬁcant factor only for PHEV owners.As observed in Table 3, longer commute distance in PHEVs has a positive e ﬀect on the mixed use of charging infrastructure for PHEV owners, like Home-Work andWork- Public and a negative e ﬀect onWork only charging group.Assuming PHEV owners want to increase their proportion of electric miles, reduce the vehicle operating cost, and reduce tailpipe emissions, they may want to charge their vehicles more often.Consequently, if drivers commute distance is longer they seem more motivated to seek out additional charging opportunities.Multiple case studies have discussed the importance of public infrastructure for residents of multi-unit dwellings ( Peterson, 2011) ).To control for this e ﬀect, we interact dwelling type of respondents i.e.

whether the respondent resides in an apartment complex with the availability of L2 public chargers within 300 m of residence for PHEV owners. For BEV owners, we explore theinteraction between dwelling type and availability of L2 and DC Fast public chargers within 300 m of residence.We observe that there is no signi ﬁcant eﬀect on the choice of charging location for most of the charging behavior groups.It is signiﬁ cant and positive for only the Work-Public group among BEV owners.Since this group is characterized by BEV owners living in apartments with lowerlikelihood of access to L2 charger at home but free workplace charging, public chargers near the multi-unit dwelling can play an important role in satisfying their charging needs.Among PHEV owners, availability of L2 chargers within 300 m have a negligible but signiﬁcant eﬀect for the Work-only (positive e ﬀect) and the Home-work group (negative e ﬀect).

One potential reason for the overall lack of signi ﬁcant eﬀect of public charger availability near multi-unit dwelling can be that BEV and PHEV owners may self-select into apartment complexes where charging infrastructure is available in the complex parking facilities and therefore don ’t have to rely on public infrastructure for vehicle charging. We also perform sensitivity analysis to consider the impact of public chargers within 500 mof residence and 1 mile of a residence.We do not ﬁnd any impact of public infrastructure on the choice of charging location by households.Though the exploratory analysis involving only the spatial distribution of charging location indicated an impact of urbandensity, when we controlled for all the other factors inﬂ uencing charging behavior, we did not ﬁnd a signi ﬁcant e ﬀect of urban density on BEV or PHEV owners.1Table 3 Multinomial logistic regression for PHEV owners.

Note: the coe ﬃcients colored with blue were positively signi ﬁcant at the level of 0.05, and red were negatively related at the level of 0.05. 1Urban density is controlled using a dummy variable.A more detailed analysis of urban density may change the results.J.H.Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 115.Conclusion In this paper, we used results from a 7-day charging behavior survey to capture variation in charging patterns among PEV owners.Based on the use of di ﬀerent levels of chargers at di ﬀerent locations, we could analyze week-long patterns of charging behavior for BEV and PHEV owners.Although there is negligible daily variation in the charging during weekdays, di ﬀerent charging patterns for weekdays and weekends among BEV and PHEV owners were identi ﬁed.Using the charging data, we classi ﬁed survey takers into seven di ﬀerent groups of PEV owners based on their charging patterns.

37.8% of the BEVs and 30.5% of the PHEVs use more than one location and, in many cases, di ﬀerent charging powers over the week. However, both BEV and PHEV owners relied heavily on home charging, with more than half of them only using home chargers.This highlights the ﬁndings of previous studies that found home location charging to be the most important and most frequently used location.In terms of choice of the charging infrastructure, PHEV owners were found to be dependent on L1 chargers at home about three times more than BEV owners.This may be due to the current vehicles having smaller capacity batteries that can charge fully overnight on level 1.Using a set of multinomial logit models, we analyzed potential factors that may characterize di ﬀerent charging patterns.

Socio- demographic characteristics like household income, home ownership, and gender of the driver, PEV characteristics like electric range and age of the vehicle, travel behavior, electricity cost at home, workplace charging availability and accessibility to L2 charger at home were found to be the key factors in ﬂuencing the infrastructure use patterns. Commute distance is a crucial factor for mixed usage of charging infrastructure among PHEV owners, indicating that PHEV drivers who reside far from their workplace are morelikely to use workplace charging along with other options, allowing them to maximize the use of the electric range of the vehicle.Current PEV infrastructure models are often developed to investigate home, work, or public charging events in isolation.The results here show that the use of these three infrastructure types is interconnected, some owners display more mixed-use of the charging infrastructure than others.

This highlights the importance of having an integrated infrastructure investment plan that will account for di ﬀerent locational charging patterns among PEV owners. 5.1.Policy implications The results of this study show that home is the most frequently used charging location for PEV owners.Supporting the devel- opment of home location charging should be an important consideration for policymakers, particularly in multi-unit dwellings and those without o ﬀstreet parking.PEV adopters living in apartments are at present mostly dependent on workplace and public in- frastructure.As the PEV market moves along the di ﬀusion curve from early adopters living in detached homes with the ﬂexibility to install chargers at home to the early and late majority adopters ( Lee et al., 2019) the importance of chargers in multi-unit dwellings will increase.However providing universal access to charging to residents in multi-unit dwelling may be challenging.

The results of the logit model show that workplace charging is used more frequently by multi-unit dwelling residents than any other non-home charging location, including DC Fast public charging. In other words, for people without home charging level 2 workplace charging can be a viable alternative.Level 2 work charging is also important for BEV owners who only have level 1 charging at home, reinforcing the importance of this charging location.Development of workplace charging could in some regions enable the grid to align load demand with supply of solar energy from distributed and utility-scale photovoltaic cells.In 2018, California State Gov- ernment changed the building codes and made solar cells mandatory for all new construction.Utilities have expressed concern about the proposition, particularly in relation to the ‘duck curve ’problem –the imbalance between peak demand and renewable energy production.

Considering workplace as a frequently used charging location, using appropriate pricing mechanisms commuters can beincentivized to plug-in their vehicle at a time when electricity production from solar energy is maximum. One interesting result in this study is that more owners of 200-mile plus range BEVs like Tesla BEVs and the Chevrolet Bolt charge only at home.This may have implications for the future development of non-home PEV charging infrastructure.At present infra- structure planning decisions are often made with data from 100 miles BEVs, as they were the dominant PEV in the market.These vehicles are more reliant on work and public chargers.However, in the recent past, all but one of these BEVs has been taken from the market by automakers.Longer range BEVs look set to become the majority of BEVs on the roads in future years and these vehicles may have a reduced or di ﬀerent need for the infrastructure.5.2.

Future research Understanding location-based infrastructure use is insightful for planning purposes. It is also important for researchers to consider charging behavior beyond diurnal trends.As our study shows there are di ﬀerences in charging behavior during the week and the weekend.In particular, there are di ﬀerences in the number of workplace charging events during the weekend, which is not sur- prising.However, we didn ’tﬁnd a signi ﬁcant di ﬀerence in DC fast charging during the week and the weekend.One reason could be that BEV owners at present potentially use another vehicle for weekend travel (as they mostly all have an ICE vehicle).In future, moreDC fast charging events may emerge during the weekend partially due to longer range BEVs entering the market and because of expanding DC fast charging infrastructure.Understanding this trend will be important for developing PEV charging infrastructure thatﬁts all travel behavior needs, not just the most frequently made trips (e.g.

commuting). The results in this study are from self-reported charging behavior of PEV owners in the week prior to taking the survey.As the data is self-reported for a speci ﬁc 7-day period it is possible that for some respondents it does not fully align with their usual charging behavior.For example, the week prior to taking the survey could have been an anomaly meaning the information we have is notrepresentative of a typical week.However, as the sample is large, we believe the data represents typical charging behavior for PEVJ.H.Lee, et al.Transporta tion Research Part D 79 (2020) 102249 12owners on an average.To address this limitation future studies should measure consumers ’actual charging behavior, potentially by using data loggers installed on PEVs.Also, 8.9% of PHEV owners in this study do not charge their vehicles at all.A future study will investigate this behavioral pattern in more detail to understand what factors lead to PHEV owners ’decision to not charge their vehicle.

Overall, the classi ﬁcation of PEV owners based on their charging behavior and identi ﬁcation of the characteristics of the mixed users of charging infrastructure lays down the foundation for future research on infrastructure planning for PEV charging, pricing ofelectricity, and, other policy questions. In the future, we would like to model the choice of charging infrastructure considering the cost of charging and nature of commute trips as factors.We also plan to estimate the e ﬀect of associated policies like the promotion of distributed solar on the cost of PEV charging and thereby the choice of charging infrastructure.Author contributions The authors con ﬁrm contribution to the paper as follows: study conception and design: Jae Hyun Lee and Gil Tal; data collection: Gil Tal.Author; analysis and interpretation of results: Jae Hyun Lee, Debapriya Chakraborty, Scott Hardman, and Gil Tal; draft manuscript preparation: Jae Hyun Lee, Debapriya Chakraborty, Scott Hardman and Gil Tal.

This study uses energy meter-level data from the San Diegoregion to analyze the energy load pro ﬁles of residential customers under the time-of-use (TOU) rate with and without EV charging requirements. Unlike previous forecasts on the eﬀ ects of EV charging loads, the energy load proﬁle of TOU customers with EVs reveal a “twin demand peak ”where there is a peak demand during the evening hours and another at midnight.Results reveal potential issues for grid operations with greater EV adoption and the importance of careful TOU rate design.1.Introduction Major studies have demonstrated the urgent need for a rapid elec- triﬁcation of the transportation sector to mitigate catastrophic e ﬀects from climate change ( DOE, 2010; MIT, 2010 ;Slezak, 2013).Large re- ductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector requires a mix of technology solutions including a rapid elec- triﬁcation of the passenger vehicle sector to reach emissions reduction targets ( NRC, 2013 ).

Governments around the world have taken direct action to promote the adoption of the plug-in electric vehicle1(EV) using new legislation, tax incentives, and other policy instruments.California's Governor Brown has initiated the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate that targets the deployment of 1.5 million ZEVs by 2025 (CARB, 2018). Rapid integration of such a large number of EVs will inevitably cause uncertainty and variability on the operation of the existing electric power system.There is high uncertainty on not only the speed and scale of EV adoption but also the EV energy and power re- quirements.Furthermore, there is an additional unknown human factor in the anticipated mass adoption of EVs that clouds the forecasted charging load requirements: when will EV drivers actually charge their vehicles?

These uncertainties have contributed to a condition where there is no clear roadmap on building the appropriate EV charging in- frastructure that must be strategically constructed to foster a rapid, seamless transition to transportation electri ﬁcation.1.1. Literature review on EV charging behavior Numerous studies have attempted to model and estimate EV char- ging loads under various scenarios.These studies must make certainassumptions on the daily EV charging patterns that are often di ﬃcult to validate.Many studies formulate charging scenarios without any actualEV charging data; rather, the scenarios are built based on factors such as travel patterns.A number of studies use survey travel data to create charging scenarios.Sioshani and Denholm (2009) considered the “wherever, whenever ”charging case where charging occurs whenever vehicles are parked based on travel survey data of the St.Louis me- tropolitan area.Wang et al.

(2017) forecasted the EV charging demand using synthetic U.S. travel data and electricity pricing.Kang and Recker (2009) used the 2000– 2001 California Statewide Household Travel Survey to consider four di ﬀerent scenarios including the case where vehicles charge whenever they are parked as well as controlled o ﬀ -peak and public charging cases.Axsen et al.(2011) used a sample of travel survey data of new vehicle buyers in California to consider threediﬀerent charging scenarios and also incorporated the availability of an electrical outlet within 25 feet as a prerequisite to charging.Kim and Rahimi (2014) used travel pattern data at the city level to determine when EVs would be available for charging then assumed di ﬀerent EV charging scenarios.Weiller (2011) used the National Household Travel Survey to create uncontrolled and delayed charging scenarios whererestrictions are placed on certain charging times.Kelly et al.

(2012) expanded on Weiller's recharging scenarios by incorporating https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.049 Received 30 November 2018; Received in revised form 15 February 2019; Accepted 17 February 2019E-mail address: jaedkim@sandiego.edu . 1In this article, the term “EV”refers strictly to plug-in electric vehicles.Energy Policy 129 (2019) 610–618 Available online 27 February 2019 0301-4215/ © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.Tdemographic in ﬂuences on charging behavior.There are also studies that assume an ideal scenario where charging primarily occurs during late night or the “oﬀ-peak ”hours so that the overall energy load be- comes more leveled ( EPRI, 2007 ;Kintner-Meyer et al., 2007; Stephan and Sullivan, 2008).Recently, the California Energy Commission (CEC) released a major study on anticipating the required EV charging infrastructure to support the increasing number of EVs on the road (see Fig.1).

One of the key results from the study is that the expected peak EV charging load isnearly 1 GW at 7:40 p.m. on a weekday for the entire state.The ex-pected peak on weekends is nearly 800 MW at 6:50 p.m.These results suggest that EV charging would add to the existing regional load and increase peak demand, exacerbating the existing problems associated with excess renewable generation and rapid generation ramping.2The vast majority of the EV charging is expected to take place at people'shomes (i.e., residential).Therefore, the e ﬀect from residential EV charging (L1 & L2) is expected to be signi ﬁcant in both the total energy load and the shape of the load pro ﬁle (see Fig.1).One key takeaway from this study is that the forecast of EV charging loads primarilyhinges on the assumption that EV drivers charge their vehicles based on travel patterns.That is, most EVs begin charging when EV drivers arrive at home after work during peak hours (approximately 5 –8 p.m.).

This study attempts to shed light on this assumption using actual meter-levelenergy data from EV owners. Strong evidence against such charging behavior assumption would have signi ﬁcant impact on the validity and accuracy of the EV charging load forecasts, which would consequentlyhave an impact on energy policy.1.2.SDGE energy load pro ﬁle This article focuses on the San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) service territory that serves an area spanning from San Diego County to parts of Orange County (see Fig.2).SDGE is one of the three major investor- owned utilities (IOU) in California.It supplies power to roughly 1.4million businesses and residential customers in a 4,100 square-mile service area ( SDGE, 2018a ).SDGE's load pro ﬁle is primarily composed of 4 sectors: commercial & industry, residential, agriculture, and others (e.g., street lights).A summary of the energy consumption by each sector is shown in Table 1.

Although the overall energy consumption is dominated by the commercial/industry sector, the overall load shape is dis- proportionately a ﬀected by the residential sector. For example, the peak demand occurs when the residential load reaches its peak (roughly between 5 and 8 p.m.) throughout the year (see Fig.3).Therefore, changes to the residential load pro ﬁle would have a signi ﬁcant eﬀect on the overall system peak and load pro ﬁle.1.3.SDGE rate groups There are roughly 30 di ﬀerent billing rate groups within the re- sidential customers in the SDGE service territory.Many billing rates are special rates with very few actual customers.The majority of the re- sidential customers fall under the “DR”rate group.3There are nu- merous time-of-use (TOU) rate groups.Within the TOU group, there arealso speci ﬁc rate groups that are designated explicitly for residential customers who charge an EV(s) on the premise.1.3.1.

Standard rate plan (DR) The DR rate group is the default rate plan for residential customers. It is a tiered-pricing system with increasing rates with increasing usage.Each customer is given a monthly baseline usage allowance based on their location (i.e., climate zones).If a customer exceeds the baseline allowance by a certain threshold, then the rates increase from Tier 1 to Tier 2.There is a range of allowable usage within Tier 2.Once a cus- tomer exceeds the Tier 2 range, then the rates increase to the high usage charge (HUC) level.An example of SDGE's DR Tier ranges is shown in Fig.4.The baseline allowance and the high usage charge threshold vary depending on the region and time of year.The coastal regions classi ﬁed as the “coastal ”climate zone have the lowest baseline allowance be- cause it enjoys milder temperatures (less cooling and heating needs).Fig.1.Forecast of California's EV charging loads for a typical weekday/weekend in year 2025 ( CEC, 2018b ).Fig.2.

Similar to the standard DR plan, the TOU plans are also tiered plans soif a customer exceeds the baseline allowance by a certain threshold, the rates increase. 4An example of the tier pricing structures in TOU plans is shown in Fig.5.TOU rate structure Within the TOU pricing plans, there are numerous types and var- iations that are often a result of experimental rates becoming perma-nent, updated, or removed in subsequent years.Much of the di ﬀerence between these plans are minimal within the time frame of this study sothe TOU plans are grouped into two main types for brevity: TOU and EVTOU.TOU –This is the default TOU rate plan.The plan has a “peak” andTable 1 Annual energy consumption by sector in SDGE service territory (data source: CEC, 2018a ).

EVTOU –This type of plan is intended for residential customers with electric vehicle (EV) charging loads. Under each TOU plan, there are speci ﬁc hours ( “blocks ”) that cor- respond to a time-dependent rate.Examples of such time blocks are o ﬀ- peak, on-peak and semi-peak hours.These time blocks can vary de- pending on the day of the week (e.g., weekday vs.weekend) and time of the year (summer vs.winter).A visual mapping of the di ﬀerent time blocks for each TOU rate plan is shown in Tables 3 and 4.For all plans, the time blocks corresponds to the study's scope, which is from January 1st, 2016 to December 31, 2017.Based on survey of EV owners, roughly 73% of EV owners were under some type special EV electric rate plan between the years 2013 and 2015 ( CSE, 2018).It is highly likely that this percentage is even higher for the study's time span and future years due to greater awareness and availability of EVTOU plans.

One of key features revealed in the mapping of the TOU time blocks is the consistent penalty on energy consumption during late afternoon/ evening hours with the “on-peak ”rates (see Tables 3 and 4). There is also a consistent incentive for higher energy consumption with the“super o ﬀ-peak ”rates typically from midnight to early morning.2.Methodology and data Meter-level electricity consumption data for rate payers in the SDGE service territory was collected for the year 2016 and 2017.The analysis presented in this article has a scope that is limited to residential load data, which includes energy consumption in 1-hour intervals.2.1.Regional data coverage This study includes meter level data of roughly 1.5 million re- sidential customers across the city of San Diego and two out of four “climate zones ”.The SDGE service territory is divided into 30 di ﬀerent specialized regions designated as “Towns ”.Town 1 is the largest region which captures the city of San Diego.

Each Town can span across multiple climate zones. For example, the city of San Diego is Town 1 but spans across climate zones 1, 2 and 4.The number of data points vary depending on each Town and rate group.This study focuses on three regions –city of San Diego (Town 1), Coastal Zone and Inland Zone.Both the Coastal and Inland Zones ex-clude customers from Town 1 (i.e., city of San Diego).The Mountain and Desert Climate Zones are excluded from the study because of po-tential privacy issues due to the small number of customers for the TOU and EVTOU rate groups.The sample size (i.e., number of unique cus- tomer accounts) for each region's rate groups for the study is shown in Table 5 .3.Results The following sections summarize the results from analyzing the meter-level energy consumption data for the residential customers in the SDGE region.The results are segmented by three main regions, weekday or weekend and the major rate groups –DR, TOU and EVTOU.

All load pro ﬁles represent the average hourly load for a given rate group. Fig.5.Example of SDGE's TOU pricing plan for residential customers (source: SDGE, 2018c ).Table 3 Typical weekday time blocks under TOU plans.J.D.Kim Energy Policy 129 (2019) 610–618 6133.1.DR load pro ﬁles The DR rate group represent the most common customer energy proﬁle for any given region.The results closely follow SDGE's overall residential energy load pro ﬁles (see Fig.3).The results for the DR group in San Diego is shown in Fig.6.The results indicate a peak energy demand in the evening hours similar to the region's overall energy load proﬁle (see Fig.3 ).The energy load on weekends tend to be higher throughout the day regardless of time of year.The results for the DR group in the Coastal and Inland Zones is shown in Fig.7.The two regions on average have higher loads than the same group in San Diego throughout the year.

The Inland Zone has higher loads relative to the Coastal Zone especially during the summer months (Q3). This result is expected because the Inland Zone has higher summer temperatures leading to greater cooling needs.The overall shape of the loads for all regions seem consistent for any given time ofyear.There is a single main peak demand occurrence in the evening between 5 and 8 p.m.3.2.TOU load proﬁ les The average energy load for customers in the TOU rate group is shown in Figs.8 and 9 for San Diego and the two climate zones, re- spectively.Similar to the DR group, the results for the TOU group in- dicate a peak energy demand in the evening hours.Some key di ﬀer- ences between the two groups are the overall higher energy load levelsfor the TOU group and signi ﬁcantly higher energy loads for the regions outside of San Diego.Compared to the DR group, each region's TOUrate customers consume signi ﬁcantly more energy throughout the day regardless of time of the year.

Despite the higher electric rates duringpeak evening hours, customers under the TOU plans still consume more electricity during the peak hours versus non-TOU plan customers. TOU rate customers in both the Coastal and Inland climate zones consume signiﬁcantly more energy relative to the comparable group in San Diego.Some factors that may explain this result may be di ﬀerences in the square footage of homes, income and climate.3.3.EVTOU load proﬁ les The average energy load for customers in the EVTOU rate group is shown in Figs.10 and 11 for San Diego and the two climate zones, respectively.Customers in this group on average have the highest en- ergy load most likely attributable to the EV charging load requirements.Similar to the results in other rate groups, customers outside of San Diego (i.e., Coastal and Inland Zones) have signi ﬁcantly higher energy loads.More importantly, however, all three regions exhibit energy loadTable 4 Typical weekend time blocks under TOU plans.

Since the electric rates are lowest during the super o ﬀ-peak period, there is a rapid ramping of energy demand at midnight across all regions for this rate group. 4.Conclusion and policy implications Results from this study have major implications in energy policy and grid operations.Using actual energy meter data, this study captured and analyzed the real-world EV charging behavior in the SDGE service territory.The analysis reveals three main factors:4.1.EV owners respond to rate plan structure There was consistent pattern in the energy pro ﬁles of customers under EVTOU plans –EV owners begin charging their vehicles at midnight.In all three major regions –City of San Diego, Coastal Climate Zone and Inland Climate Zone –there was major ramp in energy load at midnight regardless of the time of year and day of the week.The main reason for this consistent behavior can be attributed to the incentives set by the TOU rate structure.

The most economical electric rate during the “super o ﬀ-peak ”period starts at midnight in all of the EVTOU plans. There is a rapid ramping to a peak load at midnight that decreasesquickly in subsequent hours.This ﬁnding suggests contradictory evi- dence to the CEC's forecasted residential EV charging loads (see Fig.1).One of the key factors that may be attributed to the ﬁnding is the fact that most EV owners can use smartphone applications ( “apps ”) to easily Fig.7.Average hourly load for Coastal and Inland Zone DR/DRLI residential rate group (Q1: Jan –Mar, Q2: Apr –Jun, Q3: Jul –Sep, Q4: Oct –Dec).Fig.8.City of San Diego average hourly load for the TOU residential rate group.(Q1: Jan –Mar, Q2: Apr –Jun, Q3: Jul –Sep, Q4: Oct –Dec).J.D.Kim Energy Policy 129 (2019) 610–618 615control when the charging to commence.Therefore, EV owners are simply taking advantage of the super o ﬀ-peak rates by setting the charging time using smartphone apps.4.2.

EV charging creates new peaks The load pro ﬁle of the EVTOU groups provides a good proxy mea- sure of the potential EV charging loads because it represents the actual energy usage of residences with EV charging loads. Survey results of EV owners between years 2013 and 2015 showed that roughly 73% of EV owners were under some type special EV electric rate plan ( CSE, 2018 ).It is highly likely that this percentage is even higher in future years dueto greater awareness and availability of EVTOU plans.In all regions, EVcharging loads creates “twin peak loads ”in the load pro ﬁle.The ﬁrst peak coincides with the DR/DRLI rate group's peak load, which isapproximately between 6 and 8 p.m.This peak demand is also con-sistent with the region's overall load pro ﬁle (see Fig.3).The second peak demand occurs at midnight when the super o ﬀ-peak period begins for the EVTOU group.Therefore, the second peak demand is directly attributed to EV charging and the structure of the TOU rate plan.

The results suggest that residential EV charging loads will create new peak demand rather than simply exacerbate the existing peak demand during evening hours (approximately 6– 8 p.m.). 4.3.Rate structure has major impacts Results reveal the importance of TOU rate structure design.In the standard TOU load pro ﬁles, there is a single peak load during evening hours across all regions similar to the region's non-TOU load pro ﬁle (e.g., DR/DRLI).In the EVTOU load pro ﬁles, however, there are twin Fig.9.Average hourly load for Coastal and Inland Zone TOU residential rate group (Q1: Jan –Mar, Q2: Apr –Jun, Q3: Jul –Sep, Q4: Oct –Dec).Fig.10.City of San Diego average hourly load for the EVTOU residential rate group (Q1: Jan –Mar, Q2: Apr –Jun, Q3: Jul –Sep, Q4: Oct –Dec).J.D.Kim Energy Policy 129 (2019) 610–618 616peak loads with one of the peaks occurring at midnight when the super oﬀ-peak period begins.

The load also decreases rapidly from midnight to a leveled minimum load within a couple of hours. The explicit choiceof midnight as the time when the super o ﬀ-peak period begins has a direct impact on the occurrence of the second peak demand.Since mostEV chargers are controlled easily using a smartphone app, it is highly plausible that EV owners would simply shift the charging activity to the changes in the TOU rate structure.For example, if SDGE were to change its super o ﬀ-peak period start time from midnight to 2 a.m., then the demand peak would simply shift as well to 2 a.m.Therefore, carefulconsideration of the TOU rate design is critical to shaping the load proﬁle as more EVs are adopted and charged at homes.Poor TOU rate structure design would lead to unintended consequences such as newpeak demand and rapid ramping requirements.4.3.1.

Limitations This study's scope is limited to residential EV charging in a parti- cular region (i.e., SDGE service territory) so the results may not ne- cessarily be applicable to all other geographical regions. The EV tech- nology also is still in its early adoption stages so the behavior captured in the analysis may be only re ﬂective of early adopters and not ne- cessarily represent the majority/late-adopters of the technology.Thecurrent EV population may be prone to self-selection bias in the TOU plans chosen so there is uncertainty in the generalization of the results to a future, larger EV driver population.Furthermore, the charging loads are strongly correlated to driving intensity and patterns so the results may not be applicable to a region with signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent driving patterns.4.3.2.Future research work Results from this study clearly show the importance of TOU ratestructure design with respect to EV charging loads.

Poor design of the rate structure can lead to the rise of new energy peaks and other un- intended consequences. The necessary next research step is the mod- eling and simulation of the EV charging loads as a function of di ﬀerent TOU rate structure design and technology adoption rate.For example,the SDGE service territory is expected to experience a signi ﬁcant growth of EVs over the next decade.As more EV drivers are on the road,there will be greater energy demand at the residential sector.An ana- lysis on the potential energy load pro ﬁles based on di ﬀerent TOU rate structures across regions and EV charging load requirements would giveinsights on how to best design the rate structure to induce the best charging behavior for better grid operations.Acknowledgements The author would like to thank the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) for granting access to the meter-level energy data.
