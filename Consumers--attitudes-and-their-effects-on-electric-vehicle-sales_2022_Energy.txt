Panel vector autoregression ABSTRACT  
There are close links and interactions among consumers ’ attitudes, the construction of charging infrastructure, 
and the diffusion of new energy vehicles (NEVs). This study focuses on consumers ’ sentient attitudes toward 
charging infrastructure and the effect of consumer attitudes toward the construction of charging piles and NEV 
sales using natural language processing technology and the panel vector autoregressive method. Consumers ’ 
sentient attitudes (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) were inferred by analyzing consumer comments on 
charging infrastructure obtained from the internet. The key reasons for consumers ’ negative attitudes were 
further investigated, and the diversity in their attitudes was explored at the city level. The results show a growing 
concern for consumers about charging infrastructure since 2013. The overall satisfaction of consumers has 
constantly improved. The top pain points that cause consumers ’ negative attitudes are inconvenient charging, 
charging dilemmas, inability to install private charging piles, etc. Consumers ’ negative attitudes have a signif -
icantly positive impact on the charging piles ’ construction. It also has a significantly negative impact on the sales 
of NEVs, but the effects are themselves short-term. Usually, the impact of negative attitudes is stronger than that 
of positive attitudes.   
1.Introduction 
A new energy vehicle (NEV) ’s low driving range provided by its 
battery is one obstacle to its diffusion (Gnann et al., 2018 ; Globisch 
et al., 2019 ). Research that stimulates the diffusion of the electric vehicle 
market often focuses on charging infrastructure, which is widely 
perceived as contributing to the popularization of electric vehicles 
(Skippon and Garwood, 2011 ; Axsen and Kurani, 2013 ; Plotz and Funke, 
2017 ; Palomino and Parvania, 2019 ; Globisch et al., 2019 ; Patt et al. al., 
2019; Hu et al., 2020 ). Consumers ’ attitudes are a direct indicator of the 
evaluation of charging infrastructure construction (Stoutenborough and 
Vedlitz, 2014 ; Jiang et al., 2016 ). Consumers are direct users of charging 
infrastructure, and their sentient attitudes are an important basis for 
optimizing and developing charging infrastructure. However, few 
scholars have researched consumers ’ attitudes toward charging infra-
structure. Instead, they focused on charging-load analysis (Fu et al., 
2020 ; Yang et al., 2020a ; Luo et al., 2020 ; Tao et al., 2020 ), charging 
station layout planning (Zhang et al., 2019a , 2019b ), the economic 
benefits of charging stations (Yang et al., 2020b ), and consumers ’ preferences for charging infrastructure (Patt et al., 2019 ; Fang et al., 
2020 ; Illmann and Kluge, 2020 ). 
There is little literature on consumers ’ attitudes toward charging 
infrastructure, but more on consumers ’ attitudes toward electric and 
fuel cell vehicles. Survey questionnaires (Egbue and Long, 2012 ; Lebeau 
et al., 2013 ; Larson et al., 2014 ; Junquera et al., 2016 ; Wu et al., 2020 ) 
or interviews with users (Hardman et al., 2016 ) to obtain their attitudes 
have mainly been used. However, an open social platform could restore 
the thoughts and opinions of consumers, freeing the transmission of 
information from time and geographical restrictions (Yin and Wu, 
2019 ). Therefore, this study innovatively uses natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) technology to investigate consumers ’ opinions posted on 
social media and analyzes their attitudes toward charging 
infrastructure. 
This study analyzes consumers ’ sentient attitudes toward charging 
infrastructure and explores regional differences in consumers ’ attitudes 
and the interactions between consumer attitudes, charging infrastruc -
ture construction, and NEV sales based on consumers ’ social media 
comments about charging infrastructure. First, consumers ’ attitudes

2toward charging infrastructure were quantitatively analyzed using the 
sentiment index method. Second, the main reasons that consumers had 
negative attitudes toward charging infrastructure were investigated. 
Third, from a spatial perspective, the diversity of consumers’ attitudes at 
different city levels was explored. Finally, the interactions among con-
sumers’ attitudes, the number of charging infrastructures, and the sales 
of NEVs were investigated using the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) 
method. 
The novelty of this study is as follows: First, rather than using 
traditional questionnaire data, internet data on consumers’ comments 
about charging infrastructure were collected and utilized. Consumers’ 
sentient attitudes (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) were measured 
by analyzing consumers’ comments on charging infrastructure using 
NLP technology, which is a method that is more responsive to general 
problems than one determined by hypothetical scenarios. Therefore, this 
study provides a novel approach to modeling consumers’ attitudes to-
ward charging infrastructure by using digital technology to study the 
barriers to the adoption of NEVs. Second, the diversity of consumers’ 
attitudes toward charging infrastructure at different city levels was 
explored further, and it provides a reference for policy-makers to 
formulate NEV development policies tailored to local conditions. Third, 
the impact of consumers’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure con-
struction and NEV sales was further evaluated, providing insights for the 
development of NEVs. 
The rest of this study is structured as follows: the methodology and 
data are introduced in Section 2. The results and findings are given in 
Section 3. This is followed by a conclusion and policy implications in 
Section 4. 
2.Methodology and data 
2.1. Data collection and filtering 
Five social media platforms2 about automobiles that Chinese con-
sumers most commonly used were selected to collect consumers’ com-
ments about charging infrastructure using the Python programming 
language. Keywords such as “charging pile”, “charging station” and 
“battery swap” were searched. Finally, 63,693 comment data points 
were crawled and collected. Each piece of data includes the user ID or 
username registered on the website, date, province, city, data source, 
and comment (see the Appendix, Table A.1). The period of the sample 
data is from August 2013 to June 2020. 
The comprehensive and accurate analysis depends on the comments 
being highly relevant to charging infrastructure. A keyword-matching 
method was first used to filter out the comments containing 
“charging” or “battery swap”. Then, a manual filter method was used to 
exclude comments posted by nonindividual consumers, such as adver -
tisements and news. Finally, 13,254 comments were obtained. 
A controversial question is whether the comments from consumers 
on public social media are biased because of the existence for aggressive 
comments due to the anonymity of social platforms. This study assumes 
that a small number of extreme comments cannot affect the results based 
on the following reasons. First, the number of extreme comments is 
relatively too small to affect the results, and second, the emotional po-
larities of positive and negative sentiments in consumer comments do 
not change even if there are aggressive comments. However, when NLP 
technology is used to analyze consumer sentiment, there are still 
methods that can further improve the robustness and sensitivity of the 
analysis. For example, when dictionaries are used to quantify the posi-
tive and negative emotions of consumer comments, the impact of con-
sumers’ excessive emotional catharsis on the results can be reduced by reducing the weight of some extreme words. And for research that at-
tempts to obtain more detailed emotional categories of the public, ma-
chine learning method can be used to classify the public’s emotions into 
more emotional categories (e.g., hope, happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, 
etc.) (Cao et al., 2021; Kabir and Madria, 2021), or analyze public 
sentiment from different dimensions of magnitude and polarity (Corbett 
and Bastin Tony Roy Savarimuthu, 2022). 
Additionally, the data regarding the number of charging infrastruc -
ture constructions came from the China Electric Vehicle Charging 
Infrastructure Promotion Alliance (http://www.evcipa.org.cn/). Data in 
27 sample provinces and cities from February 2016 to October 2019 
were selected because of the lack of data in other provinces, namely, 
Anhui, Beijing, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, 
Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, Jilin, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, 
Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shanghai, 
Sichuan, Tianjin, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Chongqing. 
The sales volume of NEVs mainly included the sales volume of pure 
electric vehicles (PEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). 
The data came from Dasouche Zhiyun (https://zhiyun.souche.com). 
2.2. Analytical methods 
The sentiment analysis of each comment was performed by using 
NLP technology. A sentiment value greater than 0 was a positive atti-
tude, a sentiment value less than 0 was a negative attitude, and a 
sentiment value equal to 0 was a neutral attitude. On this basis, for all 
negative attitude comments, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) theme 
modeling approach was used to analyze the key reasons that caused 
consumers to have negative attitudes toward charging infrastructure. 
Second, the differences in consumers’ attitudes at different city levels 
were analyzed. Third, a PVAR model was used to analyze the in-
teractions between consumers’ positive and negative attitudes toward 
charging infrastructure, the number of charging infrastructures, and the 
sales of NEVs. The research framework is shown in Fig. 1. 
2.2.1. Sentiment analysis 
Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is the task of 
extracting and analyzing people’s opinions, sentiments, attitudes, per-
ceptions, etc., toward different entities, such as topics, products, and 
services. It is a powerful tool for businesses, governments, and re-
searchers to extract and analyze public moods and views, gain business 
insights, and make better decisions (Birjali et al., 2021). 
The BosonNLP3 sentiment dictionary was used to perform sentiment 
analysis on each consumer’s comment (Fig. 1). First, the BosonNLP 
sentiment dictionary was loaded. Second, the Jieba word segmentation 
tool4 was used to segment each comment. Third, the stop vocabulary 
2 Autohome inc. (http://ir.autohome.com.cn/), PCauto (bbs.pcauto.com.cn), 
Xcar (http://www.xcar.com.cn/bbs/), Weibo Corp (https://weibo.com/), and 
Zhihu (https://www.zhihu.com/). 3 BosonNLP sentiment dictionary is an emotional polarity dictionary based on 
data sources such as Weibo, news, and online forums. It contains many online 
vocabulary and informal abbreviations, and has a high coverage of nonstandard 
language expressions. It is suitable for text analysis of online social media (Yin 
and Wu, 2019).  
4 Jieba is a Python Chinese word segmentation component, which provides a 
dictionary of Chinese character prefixes. For the words in the prefix dictionary, 
a directed acyclic graph is constructed, and word segmentation can be 
completed via dynamic programming. For words that do not exist in the prefix 
dictionary, a hidden Markov model is needed. Developers can also specify a 
custom dictionary to include words that are not in the Jieba thesaurus, and 
adding new words by themselves can ensure a higher accuracy rate. For a more 
detailed introduction, please visit: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba. Y. Wang et al.

3list5 of the Harbin Institute of Technology was used to clean up the word 
segmentation results. Finally, the BosonNLP sentiment dictionary was 
used to score the sentiment of each comment. A sentiment value greater 
than 0 was a positive attitude, a sentiment value less than 0 was a 
negative attitude, and a sentiment value equal to 0 was a neutral atti-
tude. Finally, 8526 positive comments, 4616 negative comments, and 
112 neutral comments were obtained. 
In addition, the release of policies related to charging infrastructure 
and electric vehicles may also cause fluctuations in consumers ’ senti-
ment. Therefore, to analyze whether policy releases have a direct impact 
on consumers ’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure. First, “new 
energy vehicles ” and “charging piles ” were used as keywords to search 
the Chinese government website (http://www.gov.cn ), and all “policy ” 
type contents were saved. Then, the number of policies in 2013.1- 
2020.6 was calculated, and 88 policies were obtained. Finally, the 
Pearson correlation coefficient method was used to analyze the corre -
lation between the number of positive/negative attitudes and the 
number of policies, and the results showed that there was no correlation 
between consumer attitudes and policy releases. Therefore, changes in 
consumer attitudes are caused by the construction of charging 
infrastructure. 
Consumers ’ sentiment index toward charging infrastructure in the 
t-th month is characterized using the following equation: 
Sentiment index tln1pos tE1neg t (1)  
where post represents the number of positive attitude comments in 
month t, and negt represents the number of negative attitude comments 
in month t. When there are more positive attitude comments, the con-
sumer sentiment index is greater than 0; otherwise, it is less than 0. 
2.2.2. LDA model 
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) technology is a probabilistic 
generative model originally developed for topic modeling, and its main 
purpose is to discover latent themes that permeate a corpus. Once an 
LDA is trained, two outputs are generated: word distribution per topic 
and topic distribution per document. The latter can be regarded as 
another document representation in which word frequencies and se-
mantic information (topic composition) are considered (Kim et al., 2019 ). Fig. 2 shows how each parameter is connected to documents and 
words (Sarkar et al., 2016 ). Suppose there are M documents, N words in 
the documents, and K topics you want to generate. 
In an LDA model, choosing the number of topics K is considered one 
of the most challenging problems. The optimal number of topics can be 
derived from perplexity or human judgment (Hagen, 2018 ). Perplexity6 
is usually used to measure the quality of a trained language model in 
NLP. Blei et al. (2003) used perplexity in an LDA model to determine the 
optimal number of topics. The lower the perplexity is, the better the 
performance of the model. For a test set containing M documents, the 
perplexity is calculated as follows: 
perlexitye ⋃M
d1logpWd⋃M
d1Nd(2) 
The occurrence probability of each document (pW) is calculated as 
follows: 
pW̂
zpz̃N
n1pwn†z (3)  
where in Equations (2) and (3), z is the topic variable and N represents 
the number of words in the document. 
In this study, the LDA model was used to classify and analyze the 
reasons for negative attitude comments. The perplexity was first calcu -
lated, and then the number of topics with the lowest perplexity was the 
value of K. 
2.2.3. PVAR model 
The panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model was proposed by 
Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988) . It combines the traditional vector autore -
gressive (VAR) method (i.e., all variables in the system are treated as 
endogenous variables, and there is no need to set the causal relationship 
between variables in advance) with the panel data method, allowing 
unobserved individual heterogeneity (Love and Zicchion, 2006 ). 
Compared with the long-term sequence requirements of the traditional 
VAR model, the PVAR model has the characteristics of a large 
cross-section and a short time sequence (Zhang et al., 2016 ). Therefore, 
this study is suitable for using the PVAR model to analyze the in-
teractions between consumer attitudes, NEV sales, and the number of 
Fig. 1.Research framework of consumers ’ attitudes.  
5 Stop words are words automatically filtered out before or after processing 
natural language data (or text) to save storage space and improve search effi-
ciency in information retrieval. Stop words are usually divided into two cate-
gories. One is functional words with no actual meaning, such as “the”, “is”, and 
“at”. The other is words that are widely used, such as “want ”, which make it 
difficult to help narrow the search range and reduce search efficiency. 6 Perplexity is a canonical figure for describing the modeling capabilities of a 
language model (Bimbot et al., 2001). It is monotonically decreasing in the 
likelihood of the test data, and is algebraically equivalent to the inverse of the 
geometric mean per-word likelihood. A lower perplexity score indicates better 
generalization performance (Blei et al., 2003 ). Y. Wang et al.

number of NEVs sold in the i th province in month t, and lnCP it is the 
natural logarithm of the cumulative number of public and private

the data source. 
3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Evolution characteristics of consumers ’ attitudes 
The consumer sentiment index for the charging infrastructure is 
shown in Fig. 3. First, consumers have been increasingly concerned 
about charging infrastructure since 2013, according to the number of 
positive and negative comments, which increased by 51% on average 
every month. Second, the positive comments on charging infrastructure 
are in the majority. The proportion of months with consumer sentiment 
index greater than 0 accounted for 95%, and the average consumer 
sentiment index was 0.56. Third, it shows growing consumer satisfaction 
with charging infrastructure over time because the fluctuation of the 
consumer sentiment index, measured with the variance, decreased from 
0.29 before 2017 to 0.07 after 2017 with the improvement of charging 
infrastructure. 
3.2. Main influencing factors of consumers ’ attitudes 
NLP technology was used to analyze all negative comments to 
explore the main factors that caused consumers to have a negative 
attitude toward charging infrastructure. First, Jieba word segmentation 
was performed for all negative comments, and the frequency of each 
word was counted. Second, perplexity calculation was used to determine 
the number of topic classifications, and then the LDA model was used to 
group consumers ’ main concerns about charging infrastructure. Third, the n-gram word segmentation method was used to analyze the main 
reasons that affect consumers ’ attitudes. Fourth, evolutionary charac -
teristics of consumers ’ attention to charging infrastructure were 
analyzed with half a year as the time interval. 
3.2.1. Word frequency statistics 
The 50 most frequently used words among all negative comments are 
shown in Table 1. This shows that in addition to the two basic words 
“charging pile” and “charging ”, consumers ’ main concerns include the 
installation of private charging piles (e.g., “install, ” “parking space, ” 
“property, ” “community, ” “electricity meter, ” and “wires ”), battery 
driving range (e.g., “battery, ” “range, ” “kilometer, ” “motorway ”), and 
the mode of charging infrastructure to supplement power for electric 
vehicles (e.g., “home, ” “fast charging, ” “slow charging, ” “battery swap 
station ”), etc. Additionally, many words can reflect the psychological 
state of consumers, e.g. “anxiety ” and “want ”. 
3.2.2. LDA topic classification 
The LDA model was used to classify the negative comments. First, the 
perplexity was calculated according to Equations (2) and (3), with the 
number of topics K [1, 2 …, 50]. The calculation results are shown in 
Fig. 4. Perplexity was lowest when K 6. 
Therefore, the optimal topic number is six, and the top five keywords 
with the highest weight are extracted for each topic. According to word 
frequency statistics, these 30 keywords account for 17.3% of all 18,783 
words. Then, the trigram algorithm was used to obtain accurate infor-
mation about consumer comments. The trigram algorithm can form a 
phrase for every three words from the beginning to the end of a sentence, 
and then it counts the frequency of each phrase, so consumers ’ intent 
can be fully understood. The top five keywords for each topic and the 
phrases related to each keyword with the highest frequencies are shown 
in Table 2. 
As shown in Table 2, Topic 1 is highly related to the “charging 
method ”, consumers hope to use private charging piles at home to 
charge an electric vehicle easily. When a private charging pile cannot be 
installed, they usually use the high-power socket at home to connect the 
charging cable to charge the electric vehicle. Topic 2 is related to the 
“range of electric vehicles ”, including the mileage of an electric vehicle 
after being fully charged and charging electric vehicles on motorways to 
increase the range. Topic 3 is the “installation problem of private 
charging piles ”. Private charging piles cannot be installed because there 
are no fixed parking spaces, or the community property management 
Fig. 2.LDA analysis framework.  Y. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983
5firm obstructs the installation of private charging piles. Topic 4 is the 
“performance shortcomings of electric vehicles, ” including the travel 
distance of electric vehicles, battery life, attenuation of the driving range 
because of turning on air conditioning, and long charging time. Topic 5 
is related to “range anxiety, ” including charging time, driving range 
anxiety, power loss caused by air conditioning, and whether there are 
charging piles in motorway service areas. Topic 6 is related to the 
“charging dilemma ” because consumers cannot install private charging 
piles. They need to use high-power sockets at home to charge or find public charging piles outside the community, thus facing the dilemma of 
inconvenient charging and high charging prices. 
According to the six topics, the main reasons for consumers ’ negative 
attitudes toward charging infrastructure are summarized. First, the 
charging is inconvenient. Second, the driving range of PEVs is limited. 
Third, private charging piles cannot be installed. Fourth, the charging 
mode was not satisfactory. Fifth, consumers ’ range anxiety. Sixth, the 
charging dilemma of charging piles. 
3.2.3. Evolutionary characteristics of the topics 
In this section, the evolutionary characteristics of those 6 topics were 
analyzed to capture the changes in consumers ’ concerns at half-year 
intervals. First, Jieba word segmentation was performed on the nega-
tive comments in each period. Then, Equation (5) was used to calculate 
consumers ’ attention degree to each topic in different periods. 
AD it̂5
j1fijt×wiji1C2C…C6 (5)  
where ADit is the consumers ’ attention degree to topic i in period t, fijt is 
the word frequency of the j th keyword in the i th topic in period t, and 
wij is the weight of the j th keyword in the i th topic obtained in the LDA 
topic modeling. 
Fig. 5 shows the degree of consumers ’ attention to each topic in 
different periods. Consumers ’ concerns are highly consistent in different 
periods. The charging method and charging dilemma are the two top 
topics with which consumers are most concerned. Therefore, convenient 
charging infrastructure has always been the largest demand of

6consumers. 
Fig. 5 also shows that compared with other topics, the driving range 
of PEVs and the range anxiety are less concerned by consumers. Ac-
cording to a survey of electric vehicles’ travel characteristics, the 
average daily travel distance of private electric vehicles is 69 km 
(approximately 43 miles).7 The main scene of consumers’ range anxiety 
is long-distance travel, according to the analysis in Section 3.2.2. 
Therefore, the convenience of daily charging is the main problem faced 
by consumers. 3.2.4. Further analysis 
This section further analyzes different types of charging piles, 
different charging scenarios, and the improvement measures that con-
sumers expect from charging infrastructure. 
First, for DC fast charging and AC slow charging, all negative com-
ments containing the keywords “fast charging” and “slow charging” 
were screened out respectively. Among them, 4.68% of the negative 
comments mentioned “fast charging”. 5.91% of the negative comments 
mentioned “slow charging”, indicating that more consumers pay atten -
tion to slow charging. Then, using the trigram segmentation method, the 
terms associated with “fast charging” and “slow charging” were ob-
tained respectively, and the following social network graph was formed Table 2

Wang et al.

7(Fig. 6). It can be found that worrying about fast charging harms the 
battery and affecting the service life of the battery, and worrying that 
fast charging speed will cause some virtual power are the main reasons 
why consumers have negative emotions about fast charging piles. The 
slowly charging speed that resulting in longer charging waiting time, 
and the property does not agree to install private slow charging piles in 
the community are the main reasons why consumers have negative 
emotions about slow charging piles. 
Second, for different charging scenarios, all negative comments 
containing keywords such as “expressway ”, “home ”, “company ”, and 
“charging station ” were screened out respectively. Among them, “home ” 
was the charging scene with the highest number of comments, ac-
counting for 8.56% of the total number of negative comments, followed 
by “expressway ” accounting for 4.72%, “charging station ” and “company ” accounting for 3.79% and 1.13%, respectively. Then, the 
trigram segmentation method was used to obtain the terms associated 
with “expressway ”, “home ”, “company ”, and “charging station ” 
respectively, and the following social network graph was formed 
(Fig. 7). It can be found that due to the inability to install private 
charging piles, the air-conditioning socket is used at home to charge the 
electric vehicle, there are problems such as circuit cutting and the 
inability to pull the wire due to the high floor is the main reason why 
consumers have negative emotions about the charging scene “home ”. 
The lagging construction scale of charging piles leads to queues when 
charging on the expressway, causing expressway traffic congestion, and 
worrying about the lack of charging piles on the expressway are the 
main reasons why consumers have negative emotions about the 
charging scene “expressway ”. Fears that there are no charging stations

8in the expressway service area, and hope that the number of charging 
stations will be the same as the number of gas stations are the main 
reasons why consumers have negative emotions about the charging 
scene “charging station ”. Therefore, consumers who need long-distance 
travel pay more attention to the construction of public charging piles. 
Concerns about insufficient charging parking spaces, the lack of public 
charging piles near the company, and the incompatibility of charging 
pile types are the main reasons why consumers have negative emotions 
about the charging scene “company ”. In addition, in the social network 
graph, the thicker the connecting line, the greater the weight of the 
node. Therefore, Fig. 7 shows that, in all charging scenarios, consumers 
are most concerned about installing private charging piles at home and 
the charging piles in expressway service areas. Finally, how do consumers hope to improve the charging infra-
structure? 42 negative comments with the keyword “hope ” were 
screened out, accounting for 0.95% of all negative comments. Then, the 
trigram segmentation method was used to obtain the terms associated 
with “hope ”, and the following social network graph was formed 
(Fig. 8). It can be found that consumers want to improve the charging 
infrastructure in four areas. First, it is hoped that the community allows 
to install the charging piles, and the property can agree and assist in the 
installation of charging piles. Second, it is hoped that the number of 
charging piles will increase, including the construction of more charging 
piles in urban areas and expressway service areas. Third, it is hoped that 
the driving range of electric vehicles will increase, and the battery 
attenuation will be less. Fourth, it is hoped that the charging software

9can be more intelligent, showing whether the nearby charging parking 
spaces are parked, and whether there are already cars charging in the 
charging piles. 
3.3. Analysis of regional differences 
This section analyzes consumers’ different attitudes toward charging 
infrastructure at different city levels.8 
First, the sentiment index of consumers at different city levels was 
calculated according to Equation (1), as shown in Fig. 9. It is found that 
consumers at different city levels have different sentiment indices for 
charging infrastructure. The more developed the cities are, the lower the 
consumer sentiment index and the higher the proportion of negative 
sentiments. The less developed the cities are, the higher the consumer 
sentiment index and the higher the proportion of positive sentiments. 
The attention degree of consumers at different city levels to each 
topic is shown in Fig. 10. Topic 1 “charging methods” is the most con-
cerning topic for all city levels, followed by Topic 6 “charging dilemmas” 
and Topic 3 “private charging pile installation”. There is generally low 
attention to driving range and range anxiety. This indicates that con-
sumers are generally more concerned about the convenience of 
charging. Therefore, improving the convenience of charging will effec-
tively overcome the shortcomings of battery performance and help to 
promote the diffusion of NEVs. 
For topics 3 and 6 in Fig. 10, consumers in first-tier cities, new first- 
tier cities, and second-tier cities pay more attention than those in fourth- 
tier cities and fifth-tier cities. This may be due to the more developed 
economies of second-tier and above cities, facing serious air pollution, 
traffic congestion, and other problems. Therefore, the government has 
made greater efforts to promote NEVs, and NEV ownership is higher. 
However, the cost of land in second-tier and above cities is high, and 
both the installation of private charging piles and the construction of 
public charging stations will face more problems. Although consumers 
in third-tier, fourth-tier, and fifth-tier cities pay significantly more 
attention to electric vehicle charging methods than those in second-tier 
and above cities, their attention to the driving range, private charging 
pile installation, range anxiety, and charging dilemma are all relatively 
low. This may be because consumers in third-tier cities and below have a 
low degree of recognition of NEVs. However, due to slight environ -
mental pollution in these cities, consumers are less willing to buy NEVs, 
and most consumers who buy NEVs to reduce the car using cost can 
conveniently charge. 
3.4. Interactions between consumers’ attitudes, charging infrastructure 
construction, and NEV sales 
3.4.1. Panel unit root test and lag interval selection 
The stationarity of each time series was tested to prevent spurious 
regression using Stata 14. Table 3 shows the results of the Levin-Lin-Chu 
(LLC) unit root test. All variables are stationary series at the 95% con-
fidence level. 
Then, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information 
criterion (BIC), and Hannanqing information criterion (HQIC) were used 
to estimate the lag interval (see Appendix, Table A.2). The lag interval 
was equal to 1 for the PVAR model of negative attitudes, charging pile 
construction, and NEV sales. The lag interval was equal to 7 for the PVAR model of positive attitudes, charging pile construction, and NEV 
sales. Because the HQIC provides a consistent estimate of the true lag 
interval (Lutkepohl, 2005). 
3.4.2. Impulse response relationship analysis 
The impulse response function9 was used to analyze the impact on 
the other two variables when one variable (i.e., consumer attitudes, the 
number of charging piles, and the sales of NEVs) fluctuates. Thereby 
revealing the interactions between consumers’ positive attitudes, the 
number of charging piles, and the sales of NEVs in Fig. 11 and the in-
teractions between negative attitudes and the other two variables in 
Fig. 12. 
Fig. 11 shows that the positive fluctuation in a positive attitude has a 
positive impact on the NEV sales and a higher positive impact on the 
construction of charging piles. Second, the positive fluctuation in NEV 
sales positively impacts consumers’ positive attitudes after two periods 
of negative impact and has a continuously positive impact on the con-
struction of charging piles. Finally, the positive fluctuation in the con-
struction of charging piles has a significant and continuous positive 
impact on consumers’ positive attitudes and NEV sales. 
Fig. 12 shows that, first, the positive fluctuation in negative con-
sumer attitudes has a long-term negative impact on NEV sales. It also has 
a positive impact on the construction of charging piles. However, 
negative attitudes’ cumulative negative impact on NEV sales is signifi -
cantly greater than its cumulative positive impact, according to the area 
enclosed by the impulse response curve and the coordinate axis. This 
indicates that solving the main factors that cause consumers’ negative 
attitudes will be more helpful in promoting the diffusion of NEVs. Sec-
ond, the positive fluctuation in NEV sales has a cumulatively positive 
impact on consumers’ negative attitudes and has a continuously positive 
impact on the construction of charging infrastructure after one lag 
period. Finally, the positive fluctuation in the construction of charging 
infrastructure negatively impacts negative attitudes, and has a contin -
uously positive impact on NEV sales. This indicates that the construction 
of charging infrastructure will promote NEV sales. 
3.4.3. Variance decomposition 
Fig. 13 shows that for negative consumer attitudes, the average 
contribution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 0.77%, and the average 
contribution rate of charging infrastructure construction fluctuations is 
2.7%, which means a significantly higher impact. Second, for the con-
struction of charging infrastructure, the average contribution rate of 
consumer negative attitude fluctuations is 1.66%. The average contri -
bution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 4.93%, which means a signifi -
cantly higher impact. Finally, for NEV sales, the contribution rate of 
charging infrastructure construction fluctuations is 10.73%, and the 
average contribution rate of negative consumer attitude fluctuations is 
11.82%, which means a significantly higher impact. 
Fig. 14 shows that for positive consumer attitudes, the average 
contribution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 0.15%, and the average 
contribution rate of charging infrastructure construction fluctuations is 
6.65%, which means a significantly higher impact. Second, for the 
construction of charging infrastructure, the average contribution rate of 
positive consumer attitude fluctuations is 0.77%, and the average 
contribution rate of NEV sales fluctuations is 1.82%, which means a 
significantly higher impact. Finally, for NEV sales, the average contri -
bution rate of positive attitude fluctuations is 0.26%, and the average 
contribution rate of fluctuations in charging infrastructure construction 
is 2.32%, which means a significantly higher impact. 8 The city level is based on the “2020 City Business Charm Ranking List” 
released by the New First-tier Cities Research Institute (https://www.yicai. 
com/news/100648666.html), which divides cities into first-tier cities, new 
first-tier cities, second-tier cities, third-tier cities, fourth-tier cities, and fifth-tier 
cities. This report assesses China’s 337 prefecture-level and above cities based 
on the collected commercial store data of 170 mainstream consumer brands, 
and the user-behavior data and city statistics of 18 leading internet companies 
in various fields (see Appendix A.3 for details). 9 The impulse response function describes the current response and the trend 
of subsequent response effects of a variable when faced with the impact of 
another variable in a system while keeping all other impacts at 0 (Zhang et al., 
2016). Y. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Energy Policy 165 (2022) 112983
104.Conclusions and policy implications 
In this study, consumers ’ attitudes toward charging infrastructure 
based on consumers ’ comments published on social media from August 
2013 to June 2020 were measured and analyzed using NLP technology 
and the PVAR model by distinguishing consumers ’ positive and negative 
attitudes and evaluating their effects on electric vehicle sales and 
charging infrastructure construction. Big data analysis methods were 
used to study the barriers to adopting new energy vehicles. The main 
conclusions are summarized as follows. 
First, consumers have been increasingly concerned with the charging 
infrastructure since 2013, and the proportion of months with positive 
attitudes accounted for 95%. Overall, consumer satisfaction has 
improved. 
Second, the top six pain points that cause consumers ’ negative attitudes are inconvenient charging, charging dilemmas, inability to 
install private charging piles, unsatisfactory charging modes, range 
anxiety, and the limited driving range of PEVs. Analysis of different 
charging scenarios showed that 8.56% of the charging scenarios focus on 
“home ”, impossible to install private charging piles and can only use air- 
conditioning sockets for charging are the main negative reasons. 4.72% 
of charging scenarios focus on “expressway ”, the lagging construction 
scale of charging piles in expressway service areas is the main negative 
reason. Therefore, the most concerning aspect for Chinese consumers is 
the convenience of charging infrastructure. Thus, improving the rele-
vant policies for the installation of private charging piles can help 
improve consumer sentiment, for example, policies that encourage the 
construction of communal charging piles or establishing a charging pile- 
sharing mechanism to encourage consumers to share private charging 
piles may ease the charging dilemma. Moreover, clarifying the interest 
of community properties in installing private charging piles would be 
beneficial to increasing their support enthusiasm. Then, the construction 
and layout of public charging piles also need to be strengthened. 
Third, it shows an interesting diversity of consumers ’ attitudes to-
ward charging infrastructure at different city levels. The more developed 
the cities are, the higher the proportion of consumers ’ negative attitude; 
the less developed the cities are, the higher the proportion of consumers ’ 
positive attitude. The possible reason is that there are more serious 
problems of inconvenient charging and higher charging costs of NEVs 
for consumers in developed cities. Therefore, formulating differentiated

12charging infrastructure construction policies at different levels of cities 
will also help improve consumer sentiment, for example, for the first- 
and second-tier cities, policy priority is given for solving the problem of 
inconvenient charging and charging costs. In contrast, for the third-tier 
cities and below, it is more necessary to strengthen the publicity and 
promotion of NEVs to improve consumers ’ awareness and acceptance of 
NEVs. 
Fourth, impulse response analysis shows that consumers ’ negative 
attitudes have a significant and continuing negative impact on the sales 
of NEVs, and the average contribution rate of negative attitude fluctu -
ations to the sales of NEVs is 11.82%. Consumers ’ negative attitudes 
positively impact the construction of charging piles. Still, the effects are 
short-term and gradually decline toward zero after reaching their peak 
in the 5th period. Consumers ’ positive attitudes have a positive impact 
on the sales of NEVs and the construction of charging piles. Still, its 
effect on the sales of NEVs is much smaller than that of consumers ’ 
negative attitudes. Therefore, a negative attitude plays a more important 
role in NEV sales. Thus, optimizing and solving the main factors that 
cause consumers ’ negative emotions will have a positive effect on pro-
moting consumers ’ acceptance of NEVs.

05-09 Guangxi Yulin Pcauto New energy vehicles have always been strongly supported by the state. Our community have installed a 
lot of charging piles, and the property said that special charging spaces for new energy vehicles will be 
built next to the community. In addition, the company parking lot has recently installed more charging 
piles.

05-07 Guangxi Nanning Pcauto 1. The low voltage power of the charging pile and the difficulty of over-warranty maintenance result in a 
short product life cycle. 2. Product intelligence. 3. High operation and maintenance costs caused by 
insufficient reliability and low system efficiency. 4. Noise problem. 
Peppa Pig 2018- 
02-05 Guangdong Huizhou Pcauto It’s definitely more convenient to have a charging pile, and the time can be adjusted by yourself. 
Empty 2018- 
02-05 Beijing Beijing Pcauto The charging fee is indeed much cheaper than the gasoline cost.

09-30 Shanxi Xi’an Xcar I want to buy an electric car. I asked the property today. The charging is based on commercial electricity, 
1.5 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and I suddenly lost my passion. 
Kaka 2019- 
04-25 Guangdong Shenzhen Xcar BYD Qin also has a dedicated charging pile. Charging is very convenient. The cruising range is quite long. 
Fu hermit 2020- 
04-09 Guangdong Shenzhen Weibo Obviously, public charging piles are seriously inadequate. 
Chengmo 
Morgan 2018- 
03-15 Beijing Beijing Zhihu As an ordinary user of electric vehicles, what makes me eliminate my “range anxiety” is not the range, but 
the installation of my own dedicated charging pile in my parking space. I can recharge as I go home every 
day, and I don’t have to worry about driving range in a big city like Beijing (or even going to the suburbs). 
Ren-George 2018- 
04-03 Shanghai Shanghai Zhihu In fact, it is not range anxiety, but charging anxiety! For example, when you buy a fuel car, have you ever 
cared about the fuel tank capacity and cruising range? 
tranvision 2020- 
05-07 Shanghai Shanghai Autohome Long-term rental parking spaces in our community are also not allowed to install charging piles, and the 
originally planned parking spaces with pre-installed charging piles have not been installed. 
apt43ygef98 2020- 
04-10 Shanghai Shanghai Autohome The installation of charging pile is complete, charging is much more convenient, and very cost-effective, 
the installation master is great, and the installation is very fast. 
Kidney health 2020- 
04-03 Hunan Hengyang Autohome You still have to buy an internal combustion engine car, there is no place to charge an electric car 
Shellfish 2020- 
02-15 Zhejiang Jiaxing Autohome If there is a charging pile, commuting in the urban area is very cost-effective. 
3926992 2017- 
02-20 Shanxi Weinan Autohome The charging pile problem is indeed the most troublesome, and it is the easiest to throw people halfway. I 
think there are charging piles in every service area within 100 km, so running at high speed will save a lot 
of worry. 
205534920 2021- 
02-14 Neimenggu Chifeng Autohome The community does not have charging piles and is not allowed to install. How do you deal with it? Where 
do you charge? 
9928229 2020- 
02-11 Zhejiang Ningbo Autohome The swap station is next to my house. When I first bought the car, I went to replace the battery and saved 
dozens of yuan in electricity bills. Anyway, the battery has a lifetime warranty. I am worried that there 
will be more people buying this car in the future and they will have to line up to swap the battery.
